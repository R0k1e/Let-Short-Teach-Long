\nDeployment Manager, and the User’s Guide \nWhat is the SAS Deployment Wizard? \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard is the common interface used to install and deploy all SAS 9.4 software. \nUsing the SAS Deployment Wizard, you can create and interact with the SAS Software Depot, the \nrepository of files and data necessary to install your SAS 9.4 software. When the SAS Deployment \nWizard is exercised to its full capability, it provides a broad range of deployment opportunities, from \ninstalling software on a single machine to installing on many machines across several tiers, either \nsilently or interactively. \nWhat is the SAS Deployment Manager? \nThe SAS Deployment Manager is a tool that looks very much like the SAS Deployment Wizard. \nHowever, the SAS Deployment Manager is used for post-installation configuration tasks such as \nconfiguring some products, applying hot fixes, updating metadata, and uninstalling SAS software.  \nUsing this Guide \nThis User's Guide is a high-level document providing support information for the SAS Deployment \nWizard and its processes. It is our expectation that this document, combined with the Help \ninformation available from each SAS Deployment Wizard dialog, should be sufficient information to \nassist you to install and deploy your software. However, if you need more technical information or \nwould like to see detailed screen-by-screen instructions, SAS has created the SAS 9.4 Intelligence \nPlatform: Installation and Configuration Guide, available at \nhttp://support.sas.com/94administration. As always, if you cannot find the answers to \nyour questions, SAS Technical Support is available to assist you. \nDefinition of Terms \nThis section defines terms key to installing and deploying your SAS software. \nSoftware Order Email \nThe Software Order Email contains important information about your SAS Software Package and \ninstructions for preparing to install your software. The Software Order Email is sent to the SAS \nInstallation Representative at your site.  \nIf you cannot find your Software Order Email, you should go to the web site \nhttp://support.sas.com/adminservices-SID to have it re-sent to the SAS Installation \nRepresentative at your site. \nSAS Software Depot \nThe SAS Software Depot is a centralized disk copy of your installation media. The SAS Deployment \nWizard can invoke a process that will automatically create a SAS Software Depot from any SAS 9.4 \ninstallation media you might have.  \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n2 \nSAS Installation Data file (SID file) \nThe SAS Installation Data file consists of customized installation information and product \nauthorization information. The SAS Deployment Wizard uses the installation information in the SID \nfile to install your licensed software and apply customized product authorization information to your \nsystem. The file is named something like sas94_xxxxxx_yyyyyyyy_zzz.txt, where xxxxxx is \nyour order number, yyyyyyyy is your setnumid (also sometimes referred to as “site number,” a \nunique identifier that Tech Support uses), and zzz is the operating system the order is licensed for. \nThe SID file for your software (order) will be located in the sid_files directory at the root of your \nSAS Software Depot or, if you have received media, on the first disk of that installation media. \nSAS Order Information \nThe SAS Order Information is a file that contains the list of SAS software that you have ordered. This \nlist is the same as the one that is included with your Software Order Email, but is included in your \nsoftware. The SAS Order Information file is located in your SAS Software Depot at \n/install_doc/<order number>/soi.html. \n\"Basic\" and \"Planning\" \nYour Software Order Email and SAS Order Information have a field described as \"Order Type\" or \n“Deployment Type”. The value in the field will be either \"Basic\" or \"Planning.\" Basic orders are \ngenerally straightforward single-machine deployments. Planning orders are more complex, multi-\nmachine deployments. The type of order you have helps you to identify your orders (if you have \nmore than one order) and determines the path you use to go through the SAS Deployment Wizard. \nSASHOME \nSASHOME is the file location where your SAS software is installed on a machine (for example, the \ndefault SASHOME for Windows is C:\\Program Files\\SASHome). SASHOME is determined when \nyou install software through the SAS Deployment Wizard the first time, and that location will \nbecome the default installation location for any other SAS software you install on the same machine. \nFor Windows users, this means that you will only be prompted for the SASHOME location the first \ntime you use the SAS Deployment Wizard on a machine. \nNote: The location you use for SASHOME must not contain a SAS Software Depot. \n \nIf you would like to install more than one version of SAS on a machine, you can do so by using a \ndifferent SASHOME for each version. If you are putting planned deployments of different versions of \nSAS on the same machine, you will also have to ensure that you are using different configuration \ndirectories. You should also ensure that there are no port conflicts between the two versions, \nespecially if you intend to run both versions at the same time. Furthermore, Windows users can only \nregister file types to a single version. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n3 \nDeployment Plan \nMost installations of Basic orders will not require a deployment plan. A deployment plan is a pre-\nselection of the software that will be installed by the SAS Deployment Wizard. It contains a \ndescription of what the plan deploys, identifies the target machines, and lists the software to be \ninstalled and configured. It is an XML file and is named plan.xml. \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard contains a set of standard deployment plans that may be used with \nlittle customization. If you are working with a SAS consultant in the deployment of your software, \nthat consultant has access to a tool to create a customized deployment plan for your installation.  \nIf you perform a planned deployment, a copy of the deployment plan that was used is stored in the \nconfiguration directory in the plan.<year-month-day-hour-minute>.xml format. For example: \n   C:\\SAS\\Config\\Lev1\\Utilities\\plan.2011-01-24-02.24.xml \nNote about Large Fonts \nIf you are running the SAS Deployment Wizard or SAS Deployment Manager on a computer using \nlarger fonts or a higher DPI setting, some of the pages may be truncated in the viewable area of the \napplication. You can improve this by enlarging the size of the application when it first opens. \nNote about Running Simultaneously with SAS Download Manager \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard writes to many of the same files as the SAS Download Manager. \nTherefore, instances of the SAS Deployment Wizard and the SAS Download Manager cannot be run \nat the same time.  \nNote about Deployment Registry \nIn order to support updates to the SAS software, installation data is stored in a deployment registry \ncreated in your SASHOME directory and located under <SASHOME>\\deploymntreg. This registry \nshould not be moved, modified, or deleted in any way while you have SAS software installed in \norder to ensure successful application of updates. The registry should only be deleted if you are \nperforming a complete removal of all SAS software from the machine. \nNote about UNIX Installer Account \nFor UNIX, the installer account must be the sas account with a umask of 022. The root account should \nnot be used since it will cause deployment failures. \nMany organizations increasingly avoid the use of shared user accounts to ensure that their IT \ndepartments can track and report which people are using and modifying the hardware and software \nservices. The UNIX installer account is frequently targeted as the subject of such audit control. \nHowever, for many SAS deployments, a group of system administrators may know how to log into \nthe environment using the UNIX installer account, making it difficult to look at the normal logs and \ndetermine who is acting as that account for a given action. \nIn order to facilitate audit control, you can establish a procedure that prohibits anyone from logging \nonto the UNIX installer account directly. The following steps describe this process for a system \nadministrator. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n4 \nNote:  The following steps require sudo. Not all organizations have sudo, or sudo may be rigorously protected \nsince it uses root privileges. Check with your system administrator before attempting to use sudo. \nNote:  If you decide to use this procedure, you must not use it for deploying the metadata tier of any planned \ndeployments. The SAS Metadata Server always requires the sas account in order to configure. After \nthe metadata tier has been deployed, you can use this procedure on all other machines in the \ndeployment. \n1. Log on with your personal credentials. \n2. Submit the su - sas command to allow you to operate as the UNIX installer account. This \nexample assumes the user ID is “sas”, which is the recommended user ID. If you use another \nuser ID, use it in place of sas in the command. \n3. Modify or update the SAS software. \n4. Log out of the su identity and return to your own shell. \nNote for Windows Terminal Server Users \nIf you are using a Windows terminal server, you must use the same account for every installation on \nthe terminal server and for any subsequent updates to the terminal server. \nNote about UNIX Windowing Environments \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard has a graphical user interface by default. If you are installing your \nsoftware on a UNIX system, make sure that a windowing environment—such as X11—is installed. If \nyou would prefer to use a text interface on UNIX, refer to the “Using a Text-Based Interface” section \nin Chapter 3, “SAS Deployment Wizard: Command Line Options” or in Chapter 7, “SAS Deployment \nManager: Command Line Options”. \nNote about Federal Desktop Core Configuration  \nIf you are using Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) security standards on your system, do \nnot use the autologin functionality when the SAS Deployment Wizard is performing updates and a \nreboot is required. \n \nPage 5 \n \nChapter 2 — Best Practices \nThis chapter contains suggestions about how best to use the SAS Deployment Wizard and SAS \nSoftware Depot. \nUsing Defaults \nAs you use the SAS Deployment Wizard, SAS recommends that you accept the defaults provided to \nyou throughout the dialogs. As long as the SAS Deployment Wizard remains open, you can go back \nthrough the dialogs to see and change your entries. Use the Help button to get more information \nabout what the defaults are for individual pages. \nIf you do change any initial defaults, your responses become the defaults for each subsequent pass \nwith the SAS Deployment Wizard. \nThe SAS Software Depot \nThe SAS Software Depot is a centralized disk copy of your installation media. A depot may contain \nmultiple orders with the following restrictions:  \n• \nOrders from 9.4M0 through 9.4M7 can exist in the same depot. \n• \nOrders from 9.4M8 and later can exist in the same depot. \n• \nOrders from 9.4M8 and later cannot exist in the same depot as orders from 9.4M7 and earlier. \nDirectory Structure \nThe SAS Software Depot has a common directory structure across all orders. The following is a \ndescription of the directories at the root of each SAS Software Depot and their contents. SAS strongly \nrecommends not changing the directory structure in any way manually, instead using the SAS \nDeployment Wizard for any directory manipulation that may be required. \nThere are only a few subdirectories that you should ever have to interact with: \n• \nsid_files – This is the subdirectory that contains the SAS Installation Data file (SID file) for \nyour order or orders. The SAS Deployment Wizard will ask for the location of your SID file \nduring the install process and will point to this directory by default. When you receive a new SID \nfile upon renewing your software, usually annually, you should store it in the sid_files \ndirectory as well. Tech Support recommends not deleting your original SID file. \n• \nthird_party – This subdirectory contains any third-party software required for your order that \nSAS can provide, as well as the documentation for installing it. The QuickStart Guide for your \norder will direct you to the appropriate point in the installation process to install the third-party \nsoftware. \n• \nstandalone_installs – This subdirectory contains SAS software that must be installed \noutside the SAS Deployment Wizard. Instructions for installing this software are available either \nin the ReadmeFiles subdirectory described below or in installation instructions described by \nthe preinstallation checklist, if one is available for the products. \n• \ninstall_doc – This subdirectory is divided into smaller subdirectories based on your orders. \nEach order subdirectory contains a Software Order Information file and an \nordersummary.html, which is the full list of the products contained in your order. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n6 \nIf your order includes a third_party or standalone_installs subdirectory, the readme \ndocuments describing how to install software in those subdirectories will be available in the \n/install_doc/<order number>/ReadmeFiles folder. \nCreating Media from SAS Software Depots \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard has a process by which you can create media from an existing SAS \nSoftware Depot. This process can only duplicate what was in the original order, since it is what is \ndescribed in the order’s data. Adding files, such as renewal SID files, to the SAS Software Depot will \nnot result in their automatically being included in the automated duplication process since such \nmanual movement is not recorded into the order data. Note that this process will not actually create \nthe media, but prepare images that you should burn for yourself, using whatever media burning \nsoftware you have installed. Use the following steps to copy your SAS software to media: \n1. Start the SAS Deployment Wizard from the SAS Software Depot containing the desired \norder, and at the opening Select Deployment Task dialog, select Manage this SAS Software \nDepot and click Next.  \n2. The Manage SAS Software Depot page opens. Select the software order you want to copy \nand click Create Media-Ready Image…. \n3. The Create Media page opens. In the Media Type field, select the type of media want to \ncreate. In the Target Directory field, enter the location where the media-ready images will be \ncreated. You can use the Browse… button to find an appropriate directory. Click Start to \nbegin creating the media-ready images. \n4. When the SAS Deployment Wizard has finished creating the images, close the Create Media \ndialog and click Finish on the SAS Software Depot.  \n5. Go to the target directory you selected in step 3. The SAS Deployment Wizard has created a \ndirectory structure consisting of a labels.txt file and at least one subdirectory. The \nlabels.txt file contains a list of the created subdirectories and names for them as well as \ninformation about those names. It will also list any additional steps that may be required \nbased on your specific software order. \nFind as many pieces of media as there are subdirectories in your target directory. Label each \npiece of media according to the labels.txt file.  \n6. Using your media burning software, burn the contents of each subdirectory onto the \ncorrespondingly labeled media.  \nNote: \nDo not burn the subdirectory itself on to the media, but open it and burn its contents onto the \nmedia. Use of the media you make relies on some of the files being at the top of the media. \nBurning the subdirectory inserts an extra directory level on the media that will hamper its \nuse. \nNote on Hot Fixes and Media Creation \nAny hot fixes in the order that you are burning to media will not be included in this process. To \nretrieve the latest hot fixes for the software in the order, create a SAS Software Depot from the media \nyou just created and start the SAS Deployment Wizard.  At the Select Deployment Task page, select \nManage this SAS Software Depot and then select Retrieve Hot Fixes on the Manage SAS Software \nDepot page in order to find and download the latest hot fixes. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n7 \nNote on Media Burning \nDuring the development and testing of the SAS Deployment Wizard, SAS discovered inconsistencies \nbetween media-burning applications, sometimes resulting in unexpected errors. Note, however, that \nthe SAS software, including the SAS Deployment Wizard, was not the cause of the errors. Instead, the \nerrors occurred as a result of failures in the burning process or as a result of different specifications \nbetween the drives burning the media and the drives reading the media. \nTry to use the exact same type of drive for burning and reading the media you create. If you use a \ndifferent drive to read the media, unexpected errors like installation hangs and messages about \ncorrupted files may occur. Testing has shown that, in every case, corruptions that occur are a result of \nthe burning process and that the hangs are a result of the reader not being able to read the burned \nmedia. Please note, though, even using the same type of drive is not a guarantee that the errors will \nnot occur; it just makes them less likely. Also ensure the media creation software you use preserves \nthe directory and file names used in the media target directory structure; that is, it does not truncate \npathname components. \nNote also that much of the burning software is operating system-specific. If you intend to use your \nburned media on a different operating system than the one used to create it, ensure that your burning \nsoftware is capable of supporting that operating system. \nFinally, the quality of the media affects the quality of the burning process. Using lower quality media \nusually results in fewer successful attempts to burn and read that media. \nMoving SAS Software Depots \nIf you decide to move or copy your SAS Software Depot from the location where it was originally \nbuilt, the method you use depends on the network status of the original and target locations.  \nMoving Between Shared Networked Locations \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard allows you to copy a SAS Software Depot from an existing one by \nchoosing the Create or Add to a SAS Software Depot at the opening Select Deployment Task page. \nIf you choose to use the Create or Add to a SAS Software Depot option, the SAS Deployment \nWizard also allows you to subset orders within the SAS Software Depot being copied so that you can \ncreate smaller depots in new locations. The Help information for the Select Deployment Task page \nand the subsequent pages describe the subsetting process. \nMoving Between Non-Shared Network Locations \nIf you are moving a SAS Software Depot between locations that are not networked, SAS has created \nthe SAS Software Depot Copy Utility for Windows and UNIX that uses FTP processes in order to \nmove a depot.  \nNote:  The SAS Software Copy Utility for UNIX uses FTP libraries. If you only have SFTP enabled on your \nUNIX machine, you can use the media creation process to copy a depot, described below.  \nSAS Software Depot Copy Utility \nThe SAS Software Depot Copy Utility copies an entire depot and places it in a target that you \ndescribe. You cannot subset your software depot using the Copy Utility. \nThe SAS Software Copy Depot Utility is located in the \\utilities\\depotcopier directory of \nyour SAS Software Depot. Windows users should double-click SASDepotCopierUtility.exe \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n8 \nwhile UNIX users should execute SASDepotCopierUtility.sh. The Command Prompt window \nwill open for Windows users, while UNIX users will see the questions in their xterm window. \nNote:  If you are working from a depot that was created by subsetting another depot, the utilities \ndirectory will not exist. \n1. The Copy Utility asks you to enter the host name of the remote machine that you want to \ncopy the software depot to. Type the location for the copy of your software depot and press \nENTER. \n2. The Copy Utility asks for the user ID for the machine you are copying to. Type the user ID \nand press ENTER. \n3. The Copy Utility asks for the password for the user ID you described in the step above. Type \nthat password and press ENTER. For security reasons, you will not see your password as you \ntype it. \n4. The Copy Utility asks for the location of the software depot on the machine you are working \nfrom. Type the location and press ENTER. \n5. The Copy Utility asks for the location on the remote machine where you want to place the \ncopied software depot. Type that location and press ENTER. When you press ENTER, the \ncopying process begins. \nNote:  The location that you select must already exist. The utility cannot create a new directory. \n6. When the copying process is complete, you will receive a success message. Windows users \ncan close their Command Prompt window. \nNote: \nIf you are copying the depot from a Windows environment to a UNIX environment, the appropriate \nexecute permissions will need to be set manually. After the copy process is complete, issue the \nfollowing command: \nchmod –R 755 <depot location> \nUsing the Media Creation Process (UNIX only) \nIf your UNIX system only has SFTP enabled, you should use the media creation process described \nabove to help with that task. It is important that whatever tool you use to move/copy the depot will \nnot affect the case of any files and that it will not truncate long filenames to 8.3 format. \n1. Perform the steps described in the \"Creating Media from SAS Software Depots\" section \nabove.  \n2. Take your media to the machine you wish to install the SAS Software Depot on. Insert the \nfirst piece of media, and select the executable that corresponds to the operating system of the \nmachine to start the SAS Deployment Wizard (for example, Windows users should use the \nsetup.exe file). If you are working from a single piece of media, at the opening Select \nDeployment Task dialog, select Create a SAS Software Depot and click Next. Follow the \ninstructions in the SAS Deployment Wizard to move your software from the media to the \nnew location. \nIf you have more than one piece of media, the SAS Deployment Wizard will automatically \nbegin with the dialogs to create a SAS Software Depot. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n9 \nDeleting SAS Software Depots \nSAS strongly recommends not removing SAS Software Depots. When you keep your SAS 9.4 depot, \napplying maintenance and upgrades become easier because you only need to download the changed \ndepot files instead of having to download an entire SAS order again. \nFor space reasons, you may want to remove a SAS Software Depot after your software has been \ninstalled. If you decide to remove a SAS Software Depot, SAS strongly recommends that you make a \nbackup of your SAS Software Depot on media so that you will have a copy of the installation files \nshould they be required. You can create media by using the process described the \"Creating Media \nfrom SAS Software Depots\" section above. \nNote that if you remove the SAS Software Depot without making a copy of it, you have also removed \nthe SAS Deployment Wizard and the files necessary to make it run. \nDeleting Software Orders from SAS Software Depots \nNote:  When you are deleting software orders, you must use the user ID that was used to create the depot. \nTo remove an order from a SAS Software Depot: \n1. Start the SAS Deployment Wizard from the SAS Software Depot containing the desired \norder.  \n2. At the opening Select Deployment Task dialog, select Manage this SAS Software Depot \nand click Next.  \n3. The Manage SAS Software Depots page opens. Select Manage SAS Software Depot and \nclick Next. \n4. The Manage SAS Software Depot page opens. Select the software order you want to delete \nin the Select a SAS Software Order pane, then click Delete Order. \n5. The Confirm Order Delete window opens, asking if you are sure you want to delete the \norder. Click Yes. \n6. The Delete Order window opens indicating that the work is being done. When the window \ncloses, the order is no longer present in the Select a SAS Software Order window. \nChanging Software Order Details in SAS Software Depots \nTo change the information associated with a software order in the SAS Deployment Wizard: \n1. Start the SAS Deployment Wizard from the SAS Software Depot containing the desired \norder.  \n2. At the opening Select Deployment Task dialog, select Manage this SAS Software Depot \nand click Next.  \n3. The Manage SAS Software Depots page opens. Select Manage SAS Software Depot and \nclick Next. \n4. The Manage SAS Software Depot page opens. Select the order for which you want to revise \nthe information, then click the Change Details button. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n10 \n5. The Order Details window opens. In the Description field, you can modify the description \nof the order that shows when the order is listed. In the Notes field, you can add information \nthat will help you with using the order in the future. After those fields contain the \ninformation you want included, click OK.  \n6. If you changed the description, the Order Description will change in the Manage SAS \nSoftware Depot page. Click Finish to close the SAS Deployment Wizard. \nManaging Your SID Files \nAs noted above, there really are only two rules of thumb for managing your SID files. First, use the \ndefault location for storing your SID files or keep an accurate record of where you store your SID \nfiles. Second, ensure that subsequent SID files that you receive are kept in the same location. Storing \nyour SID files in the sid_files subdirectory described above meets both of these objectives.  \nUsers who have an enterprise-wide deployment should also consider having their SID files in a \nnetworked location in order to ensure that all users have access to them. \nStoring and Using Deployment Plan Files \nBy default, any deployment plan files shipped with your software will be stored in the plan_files \ndirectory at the root of your SAS Software Depot. If you receive or create a customized deployment \nplan file, you should also store it in the plan_files directory. In order to differentiate between \ndeployment plan files, you can either create a new directory for each plan.xml file inside the \nplan_files directory or simply add a prefix (for example, entbiserver.plan.xml). If you do \nadd a prefix, ensure that the end of the file name does not change from \"plan.xml.\"    \nNote:  \nIf you are deploying your software using a plan.xml file and it indicates more than one deployment \nstep on the same machine, each deployment step on that machine after the first one should be performed \nwith only the Configure SAS Software option selected (leaving the Install SAS Software option \nunselected) on the Select Deployment Type page.  \nAfter your SAS software is installed, your deployment plan files are no longer strictly necessary, but \nyou may want to keep them on hand for record-keeping purposes, for possible future re-installation \nand re-configuration tasks, or for the addition of products. \n \nPage 11 \n \nChapter 3 — SAS Deployment Wizard: Command Line Options \nNote that the command line options in this chapter apply to all installations, including initial \ninstallation, add-on installations, and installing maintenance on an existing deployment. \nQuiet Installation \nA quiet installation allows you to provide all of the responses that would normally be supplied to the \nwizard when running interactively, but without the presence of a user. It is intended for use in any \ncontext that does not require a user to be present at the machine.  \nIn order to perform a quiet installation, you should first create a response file according to the \n\"Record Mode\" section of \"Record and Playback\" below. After you have created a response file, you \nshould use the information in the \"Quiet Playback Mode\" section below to perform the quiet \ninstallation on the target machine. \nWindows users should also consider the \"Restarting\" command line options in the following section \nfor use with any reboots that may occur. \nThe MIF File in Quiet Mode (Windows only) \nThe Management Information File (MIF file) is created during Quiet Mode to allow you to determine \nthe success or failure of either the System Requirements Wizard or SAS Setup. This file contains \ninformation typically used by Microsoft SCCM, but usable by any process that determines the success \nor failure of an installation. \nThe MIF file is always written to the Temp directory, and is named sas.mif by default. The MIF file \ncontains a series of START and END sections, which define certain attributes related to the tool's \nexecution. Of specific interest to determine the success or failure of the tool is the section called \n“InstallStatus,” similar to the following: \nSTART GROUP \n   NAME = \"InstallStatus\" \n    ID = 2 \n    CLASS = \"MICROSOFT|JOBSTATUS|1.0\" \n    START ATTRIBUTE \n      NAME = \"Status\" \n      ID = 1 \n      ACCESS = READ-ONLY \n      STORAGE = SPECIFIC \n      TYPE = STRING(32) \n      VALUE = \"Success\" \n    END ATTRIBUTE \n    START ATTRIBUTE \n      NAME = \"Description\" \n      ID = 2 \n      ACCESS = READ-ONLY \n      STORAGE = SPECIFIC \n      TYPE = STRING(255) \n      VALUE = \"Installation Successful.\" \n    END ATTRIBUTE \n  END GROUP   \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n12 \nThe Status and Description fields, along with their corresponding values, provide information on the \nresults of the installation. In this example, the installation was successful, as indicated by the bold \nitems above. For a failure, the fields above might be set as follows: \nNAME = \"Status\" \nVALUE = \"Failed\" \nNAME = \"Description\" \nVALUE = \"Installation aborted by the user.\" \nIf the MIF file indicates success, then there is no need to be concerned with the log file. If the MIF file \nindicates that the installation failed, and you feel more troubleshooting is necessary, you will need to \nreview the log file. \nRecord and Playback \nRecord and playback is a feature in the SAS Deployment Wizard that is used to save dialog responses \nto a file and then load those responses at a later point. The SAS Deployment Wizard provides three \ndifferent modes for record and playback. Each mode is described in detail below. \nNote that using any of the command line options in the \"Record and Playback\" section while \ncreating/managing a SAS Software Depot is not supported. \nRecord Mode \nNote:  Response files may contain passwords in plain or encrypted format. You should secure response files as \nyou would any other sensitive information. \nBeginning with SAS 9.4 maintenance 2, by default, every time that the SAS Deployment Wizard is \nrun it creates a response file that contains values for each of the prompts the user sees when running \nthe SAS Deployment Wizard. This file is named ResponseRecord_<timestamp>.log and is \nlocated in the same directory as the SAS Deployment Wizard log files: \nWindows \n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\SAS\\SASDeploymentWizard\\ \nUNIX \n$HOME/.SASAppData/SASDeploymentWizard/   \nYou can also run the SAS Deployment Wizard in record mode to force the SAS Deployment Wizard \nto create a second response file. The SAS Deployment Wizard must run to completion when creating \nthe response file in this mode. \nNote:  If you record a deployment that includes products that require interaction from the user, your response \nfile will not record those manual responses. Therefore a response file created in this fashion will be \ninsufficient for use with any method of playback (quiet or interactive).  \nUsage \n‐record \nA second, non-default response file will be created in the user’s home directory on all platforms with \na file name of sdwresponse.properties. If you want to specify the location of the non-default \nresponse file, use the ‐responsefile command line argument.  \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n13 \n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file being created>\" \nNote:  If you specify a file location where a file already exists, the pre-existing file will be overwritten by the \nSAS Deployment Wizard. \nIn addition, you can use the ‐inputresponsefile command line option to use another response \nfile as a source for creating a new response file. See the examples below. \n‐inputresponsefile \"<full path to the response file being read>\" \nBy default, no deployment occurs when running in record mode. In order to force a deployment \nwhile recording, use ‐deploy. \nNote:  If you use both the ‐record and ‐deploy options, you will be recording an installation on a specific \nmachine. Therefore, the response file that is created may not be appropriate for use on other machines. \nSAS recommends response files created using the two options simultaneously only be used on other \nmachines with caution. More specifically, if a response file is created on a machine with one version of \nInternet Protocol (IPv4/IPv6) and that file is used on a machine with a different Internet Protocol, the \ndeployment will fail. \nResponse files should only be used for software in the same software order. Using a response file \nfrom one order while deploying a second order may result in unintended discrepancies that are \ndifficult to troubleshoot. \nFinally, if you use any other command line options while using ‐record, those options are not \nincluded in the response file. To properly use the response file, you must repeat those same \ncommand line options with the playback. \nExamples \nIn each example, if a file with the specified name is already in the specified location, the SAS \nDeployment Wizard will overwrite the existing file with a new one. You will not be warned that you \nare overwriting a file. \nsetup.exe ‐record \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will record a response file named sdwresponse.properties \nand store it in your home directory. \nsetup.exe ‐record ‐deploy \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will deploy your software and record a response file named \nsdwresponse.properties that will be stored in your home directory. \nsetup.exe ‐record ‐responsefile \"C:\\foobar.properties\" \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will record a response file named foobar.properties and store \nit at C:\\foobar.properties.  \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n14 \nsetup.exe ‐record ‐inputresponsefile \"C:\\foobar.properties\" \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will read the responses in C:\\foobar.properties and use them \nto seed the default responses as it records a new response file. The new response file will be \nnamed sdwresponse.properties and will be stored in your home directory. \nsetup.exe ‐record ‐responsefile “C:\\mylogs\\ResponseFile.properties”  \n‐inputresponsefile \"C:\\foobar.properties\" \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will read the responses in C:\\foobar.properties and use them \nto seed the default responses as it records a new response file. The new response file will be \nlocated at C:\\mylogs\\ResponseFile.properties. \nQuiet Playback Mode \nUsers can suppress the user interface for the SAS Deployment Wizard by running in this mode. The \nmode requires an existing response file. If the SAS Deployment Wizard encounters a dialog for which \nthere is not a valid response in the response file, a message will be recorded in the log file and the \nSAS Deployment Wizard will return an error code of -1. There is no visual feedback while the SAS \nDeployment Wizard is running in this mode. SAS recommends that you check your log file after the \ninstallation to determine if any errors occurred. \nThe location of the log files is described in the \"SAS Deployment Wizard Log Files\" section below.  \nNote:  If the SAS Deployment Wizard is forced to reboot your machine in order to install required software, \nwhen the SAS Deployment Wizard restarts, it will no longer be in quiet playback mode. \nUsage \n‐quiet \nThe response file must already exist and will default to the user’s home directory on all platforms \nwith a file name of sdwresponse.properties. \nThe response file can be specified by adding an additional command line argument: \n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \n \nNote: \nBecause the response file created automatically by the SAS Deployment Wizard does not contain \nvalues for the passwords, SAS strongly recommends using the ‐quiet command line option only \nwith a response file that has been created using the ‐responsefile command line option described \nabove. \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐quiet ‐responsefile \"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\" \nNote on Windows Usage \nWindows users also have the ‐wait option available for their use. The -wait option forces the \nsetup.exe process to remain in the task list until the SAS Deployment Wizard completes, which is \nimportant with any provisioning software such as Microsoft's SCCM or IBM's Tivoli. The following is \nan example using the ‐wait option: \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n15 \nsetup.exe ‐wait ‐quiet ‐responsefile \"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\" \nPartial Prompting \nWhen running the SAS Deployment Wizard in partial prompt mode, the user only sees dialogs that \ndo not have a valid response in the response file. This mode is used when the SAS Deployment \nWizard resumes after being interrupted by a reboot and values originally supplied are no longer \nvalid. This can occur when mapped drives are lost after rebooting on Windows. This mode may also \nbe used by administrators to supply some of the deployment information for their users.  \nUsage  \n‐partialprompt  \nThe response file must already exist and will default to the user's home directory on all platforms \nwith a file name of sdwresponse.properties.  \nThe response file can be specified by adding an additional command line argument:  \n‐responsefile <full path to the response file>  \nExample  \nsetup.exe ‐partialprompt ‐responsefile \"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\"  \nMonitoring the SAS Deployment Wizard during Quiet Playback \nRunning the SAS Deployment Wizard in quiet mode makes it more difficult to monitor the \ninstallation and to notice if errors occur. To address this concern, you can use ‐quietstatus option \non Windows and periodically issue the ps command on UNIX and z/OS to track whether the SAS \nDeployment Wizard is running. \nWindows \nOn Windows, specify the ‐quietstatus option when invoking the SAS Deployment Wizard in \nquiet mode to display a small status dialog to help identify when the deployment is complete. In \naddition, you can add ‐minimize in order to force the status dialog to open in a minimized state. \nUsage \n‐quietstatus ‐minimize \nExample  \nsetup.exe ‐wait ‐quiet ‐responsefile \"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\" ‐quietstatus \n‐minimize \nUNIX and z/OS \nAs with most processes on UNIX and z/OS, issue the ps command to monitor the SAS Deployment \nWizard running in quiet mode. Remember that output from a ps command can be misleading \nbecause the process name returned is not always named setup.sh, since the actual script that the \nSAS Deployment Wizard is running at any given time varies. However, the process ID remains the \nsame. \nFor example, if you were to run the SAS Deployment Wizard and immediately issue a ps command \n(before the language dialog box would be displayed), you would see output similar to \n31762 pts/2 S 0:00 /bin/sh /depot/setup.sh \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n16 \nNote that the shell, /bin/sh, runs the initial script, /depot/setup.sh. The shell is the parent \nprocess, and in this example has a process ID of 31762. When setup.sh is finished executing, it \npasses control to the script, deploywiz.sh. If you were to look at the process list while the SAS \nDeployment Wizard is running, you would see something similar to the following in a process list: \n31762 pts/2 S 0:00 /bin/sh \n/tmp/_setup31762/products/deploywiz__9220__prt__xx__sp0__1/deploywiz.sh \n‐startuplocation /depot \n‐templocation /tmp/_setup31762 \nThe shell /bin/sh is still running and retains the same process ID. However, this shell is running a \ndifferent script now, deploywiz.sh. \nInteractive Playback Mode \nThe response file can also be used to default all the prompts in the SAS Deployment Wizard. In this \nmode, all the dialogs in the SAS Deployment Wizard are displayed and the default values are loaded \nfrom the response file. \nNote:  Even if you are using ‐responsefile to install your software on a UNIX system, you must still \ninstall a windowing environment, such as X11. Using ‐responsefile still invokes a graphical user \ninterface.  \nUsage \n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐responsefile \"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\" \nLogging \nYou can use the command line to specify the level of detail you would like to use in the log files for \nyour deployment. There are three levels of logging: \n• \nlog level 0 – This level sets the SAS Deployment Wizard logging to its lowest detail, \nproviding only cursory information about the deployment. \n• \nlog level 1 – This level sets the SAS Deployment Wizard logging to its default detail, verbose \nmode. \n• \nlog level 2 – This level sets the SAS Deployment Wizard logging to is highest level, debug \nmode. \nUsage \n‐loglevel <value between 0 and 2> \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐loglevel 2 \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n17 \nHot Fixes \nFor more information about the hot fix process, see the “Finding and Applying Hot Fixes” chapter. \nExcluding Hot Fixes \nIf you would prefer not to install the hot fixes in your order, you should use the ‐nohotfix \ncommand line when you start the SAS Deployment Wizard.  \nNote:  Using the ‐nohotfix option prevents you from receiving automatic security updates that are \nincluded in your software order. To find and install those security fixes, go to \nhttps://tshf.sas.com/techsup/download/hotfix/HF2/SAS_Security_Update\ns.html. \nUsage \n‐nohotfix \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐nohotfix \nIncluding Hot Fixes (z/OS only) \nIf you want to allow hot fixes in your order to be installed during later installations of software in \naddition to your original order, you should use the ‐hotfixupdate command line option. This \ncommand line creates an exception to the rule that hot fixes included with an order can only be \ninstalled in a clean SASHOME. \nUsage \n‐hotfixupdate \nExample \nsasdm.rexx ‐hotfixupdate \nChecking System Requirements (Windows only) \nBeginning with release SAS 9.4 TS1M1 Rev. 940_14w11, the SAS Deployment Wizard enables you to \ncheck your Windows order to determine what system requirements need to be met before you can \nuse SAS software. This system requirements check is usually performed during a normal deployment \nbut is immediately followed by the installation of the requirements and then the SAS software. Using \nthe ‐srwonly command line option allows you the choice of installing only the system requirements \nor not installing anything at all but instead creating a batch file that can be used on different \nmachines throughout your deployment. \nNote:  The batch file that is created should only be used on machines that are running the same version of \nWindows and which will have the same SAS products installed on them. \nUsage \n‐srwonly \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐srwonly \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n18 \nProcedure \nUse the following steps to check your Windows machine for system requirements: \n1. Start the SAS Deployment Wizard with the ‐srwonly command line option: \nsetup.exe ‐srwonly \n2. The Choose Language page opens. Choose the language in which you want to run the SAS \nDeployment Wizard. Click OK. \n3. The Select System Requirements Task page opens. Select Install System Requisites Now in \norder to perform the check and then install the requisite software or select List System \nRequirements to Install Later in order to create a batch file for later use on this or any other \nmachine using the same Windows version. After you have made your selection, click Next to \ncontinue. \n4. If you are performing a planned deployment, the Select Deployment Type page opens. (If \nyou are performing a basic deployment, skip to step 6.) Select Perform a Planned \nDeployment if you want to use a plan to filter the products you would like to check. (Note \nthat you cannot select Configure SAS Software since you have indicated by using the \ncommand line that you only wish to check the system requirements). If you do not want to \nuse a filter, select Install SAS Foundation and Related Software. \nWhen you have made your selection, click Next to continue. \n5. If you selected Perform a Planned Deployment in the previous step, the Specify \nDeployment Plan page opens. (If you selected Install SAS Foundation and Related \nSoftware, go to step 6.) Select Specify the full path to a customized deployment plan if you \nhave a plan that has been provided to you by consultants or other SAS representative. If you \nselect this option, you must also enter the location of the deployment plan in the field or use \nBrowse to search for it. If you do not have a custom deployment plan, you must use the \nSelect a standard deployment plan option. If you choose this option, you can scroll through \nthe list of available standard plans or use Search to find a plan based on words in the plan \nname. \nWhen you have selected the plan you want to use, click Next to continue. \n6. The Select Products to Install page opens, listing all the products in the software order you \nare working with. If you are using a basic deployment, ensure that SAS Foundation and \nrelated software is selected from the Products to install list. If you are using a planned \ndeployment, select the machine for which you want to check system requirements. \nScroll through the list of products and select the ones for which you want to check the system \nrequirements. You can use Select All to choose every product and Clear All to remove the \nselection from every product. When the correct products are selected, click Next to continue. \n7. If you selected SAS Foundation in step 6, the Select SAS Foundation Products page opens (if \nyou did not select SAS Foundation, skip to step 8). Select the SAS Foundation products for \nwhich you want to check the system requirements. You can use Select All to choose every \nproduct and Clear All to remove the selection from every product. When the correct \nproducts are selected, click Next to continue. \n8. The Select Language Support page opens. Because different languages have differing \nrequirements, you must select the language or languages for which you want to check the \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n19 \nsystem requirements. You can use Select All to choose every language and Clear All to \nremove the selection from every language. When the correct languages are selected, click \nNext to continue. \n9. The Select Regional Settings page opens. Because different regional settings have differing \nrequirements, you must indicate the setting for which you want to check the system \nrequirements. If you want the machine to support several languages that cannot be included \nwith a single encoding, select Configure as a Unicode server in order to force the software to \nuse the UTF-8 encoding for all cases. When you have made your selection, click Next to \ncontinue. \n10. The Required System Requisites to Install page opens, listing the requisite software for the \nproducts you selected in steps 6 and 7. Click Next to continue. \n11. If the products selected in steps 6 and 7 did not require use of all the system requirements \nassociated with all the products in the order, the Optional System Requisites to Install page \nopens. (If the Optional System Requisites to Install page does not open, skip to step 12). \nThis page lists additional system requirements for those products not selected in order that \nyou can choose to check them also. Select the requisites for which you want to check. You can \nuse Select All to choose every requisite and Clear All to remove the selection from every \nrequisite. When the correct requisites are selected, click Next to continue. \n12. The Checking System window opens, indicating that the SAS Deployment Wizard is \nscanning your machine to ensure it has enough space to install the requisite products you \nselected in steps 10 and 11. Usually, the space required is nominal, so you should have an \nempty lower pane when the scan is complete. Click Next to continue. \n13. The Deployment Summary windows opens, listing the requisite software you have chosen \nto install or add to the batch file, depending on your selection in step #3. Click Start to initiate \nthe action. \n14. A progress page opens, indicating success or failure for each product being installed. When \nthe installation is complete the Deployment Complete window opens, listing the software \nthat the SAS Deployment Wizard attempted to install and the results or the requisite \nsoftware to be added to the batch file, depending on your selection in step 3. \n• \nIf you selected Install System Requisites Now in step 3, the window describes the \ninstallation status of the requisite software. A green icon indicates that the requisite was \ninstalled successfully. A yellow icon means that the requisite was not needed for any of \nthe products that you selected because of the operating system on which the machine is \nrunning and the language and encoding choices you made previously. A red icon means \nthat the requisite installed but with errors. A blue icon indicates that the requisite was \nnot needed because it had already been installed on the machine. \n• \nIf you selected List System Requirements to Install Later in step 3, the window \ndescribes the status of adding the requisites to the batch file. A green icon means that the \nrequisite was added to the batch file successfully. A yellow icon indicates that the \nrequisite was not needed for any of the products that you selected because of the \noperating system on which the machine is running and the language and encoding \nchoices you made previously. A red icon means that an error occurred when adding the \nrequisite to the batch file. \nAfter reviewing the page, click Next to continue. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n20 \n15. The Additional Resources page opens, listing documentation that can help with your \ndeployment. If you chose to create a batch file rather than installing the requisites, the \nAdditional Resources page also lists the location of the batch file you created, under “SAS \nSystem Requisite Batch File”. Click Finish to close the SAS Deployment Wizard. \nIf a batch file was created, that file contains the order number for which the system requirements \ncheck was performed, the Windows operating system for the machine, and the products that were \nused to check against. The batch file can be used on other machines than the one where the check was \nperformed, but it should only be used with the same order and the same selected products on the \nsame Windows operating system. \nConfiguring the SAS Deployment Agent \nThe SAS Deployment Agent is a new tool in SAS 9.4 used to support configuration operations \nassociated with multi-machine mid-tier topologies and middle-tier clustering. SAS products can \ncommunicate with the SAS Deployment Agent in order to run remote processes and copy content \nover the SAS Deployment Agent connection to perform configuration management operations. \nConfiguring the SAS Deployment Agent consists of assigning a port for remote communication and \nmaking security specifications. \n The SAS Deployment Wizard also has two new command lines associated with this configuration. \nSkipping Configuration \nUse ‐skipagentcfg in order to install the SAS Deployment Agent but skip all configuration steps \nfor it. The configuration steps should be performed later using the SAS Deployment Manager (see the \n“Manage SAS Deployment Agent Service” section in chapter 6 below). \nUsage \n‐skipagentcfg \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐skipagentcfg \nForcing Configuration \nUse ‐forceagentcfg in order to override any already installed SAS Deployment Agent and \nrespond again to the dialogs in order to overwrite any existing properties. However, using ‐\nforceagentcfg will not force the credentials to be regenerated. Regenerating credentials can only \nbe performed through the SAS Deployment Manager configuration task (see the “Manage SAS \nDeployment Agent Service” section in chapter 6 below). \nNote:  The SAS Deployment Agent pages are install-time only. If you do not choose the install path at the \nSelect Deployment Type page, you will not see the SAS Deployment Agent dialogs. \nUsage \n‐forceagentcfg \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐forceagentcfg \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n21 \nMiscellaneous \nSpecifying a Different SASHOME (Windows only) \nWhen you first use the SAS Deployment Wizard on Windows, you are asked to specify the location \nwhere you would like to have your SAS software installed, referred to as SASHOME. The location \nyou enter that first time is then used as the default for all subsequent usage. If you would like to use a \ndifferent location for SASHOME than the default, use the ‐changesashome command to force the \nSASHOME dialog in the SAS Deployment Wizard. The SAS Deployment Wizard will then use this \nnew SASHOME as the default. \nNote:  Windows only allows one active SASHOME. If an already defined SASHOME contains active SAS \nsoftware and you want that SAS software to remain active, then -changesashome should not be \nused. More than one SASHOME for the same SAS release is not supported on Windows. \nUsage \n‐changesashome \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐changesashome \nConfiguring a Host Name \nNote: This SAS Deployment Wizard option is new with SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_20w26. \nIf you are performing an update or upgrade, the SAS Deployment Wizard must be run on the same \nhost that the original configuration was performed on. Over time, that host name might be changed, \nresulting in errors when an update is attempted. Using the -confighostname option allows you to \nchange the local host name that the SAS Deployment Wizard validates against to the value in the \noption. \nUsage \n‐confighostname <host name> \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐confighostname hostname.companyname.com \nUsing a Text-Based Interface (UNIX only) \nNote:  Beginning with SAS 9.4, console mode is the default for using the SAS Deployment Wizard on z/OS. \nIf you do not wish to rely on an X11 server for UNIX, you can use the SAS Deployment Wizard in \nconsole mode, allowing for the use of a headless system.  \nNote:  Console mode cannot be used with physical media; that is, you cannot use console mode to create a \nsoftware depot from DVDs. However, you can use console mode to install your software from any \ndepot, including one that is created from physical media. \nIf you use console mode, each dialog used in the installation of your SAS software is represented in \ntext, as in the following example: \nSelect a language in which to view the SAS Deployment Wizard. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n22 \n  \n( ) 1 - German  \n(*) 2 - English  \n( ) 3 - Spanish (Castillian)  \n( ) 4 - French  \n( ) 5 - Italian  \n( ) 6 - Japanese  \n( ) 7 - Korean  \n( ) 8 - Chinese Traditional  \n( ) 9 - Chinese Simplified  \n \nThe * character indicates the current selection.  \nYou can change the selection by specifying a number below.  \nEnter <q> to quit.  \nPress Enter to accept the current selection and continue.  \nSelection: \nNote:  If you are instructed to enter a sequence that includes angle brackets, such as “Enter <q> to \nquit” above, you must include those symbols. \nThe ‐console  command line option can be used with other options at the same time, such as \nrecording or playing back a response file. \nNote:    If you intend to run the SAS Deployment Wizard in console mode to perform a deployment without a \ngraphical display, ensure that the DISPLAY environment variable is unset, as opposed to it being set \nto a blank value (that is, DISPLAY= ). \nThe ‐console command line option also supports two options to specify the size of the output of \nthe SAS Deployment Wizard. Use ‐pagesize # to specify the number of lines to display before \npausing the output and ‐pagewidth # to specify the number of characters to display on a line \nbefore wrapping to another line. Note that ‐pagesize and ‐pagewidth will not work with any \nother command line option. \nUsage \n‐console [‐pagesize #] [‐pagewidth #] \nExample \nsetup.sh ‐console ‐pagesize 20 ‐pagewidth 50 \nSpecifying a Graphic Interface (z/OS only) \nBy default, the SAS Deployment Wizard uses console mode when running on a z/OS machine. If you \nare deploying your software on z/OS and have an X11 server, you can use the ‐x11 command line \noption to use the graphic user interface that is the default for Windows and UNIX. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n23 \nUsage \n‐x11 \nExample \nsetup.rexx ‐x11 \nAutomatically Submitting Jobs (z/OS only) \nBy default, z/OS users must manually submit jobs. The ‐jobsubmit command line option allows \nthe SAS Deployment Wizard to automatically submit jobs. \nUsage \n‐jobsubmit \nExample \nsetup.rexx ‐jobsubmit \nUnchaining Install Jobs (z/OS only) \nBy default, SAS install jobs are chained. To force each job to be submitted manually, use the  \n‐nojobchain option. The ‐nojobchain option is ignored if ‐jobsubmit is specified. \nUsage \n‐nojobchain \nExample \nsetup.rexx ‐nojobchain \nTurn Off Pre-Installation Validation (z/OS only) \nBy default, SAS validates data set allocation parameters for z/OS (high-level qualifier, SMS classes, \ndisk unit, disk volume, and temp unit) before the installation begins.  To turn off the pre-installation \nvalidation of these parameters, use the ‐nozosprecheck option.  \nUsage \n‐nozosprecheck \nExample \nsetup.rexx ‐nozosprecheck \n \n \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n24 \nOptimizing a SAS Software Depot \nIf you are concerned about the size of your SAS Software Depot, you can use the ‐compressdepot \ncommand line option in order to reduce the size of the JAR file repository by 30 to 50%. A depot that \nhas been optimized can have additional orders added to it. An optimized depot that has had orders \nadded to it can use the command line option again to account for the files that have been added after \nthe initial optimization. \nNote that you cannot create media from a depot that has been optimized. \nUsage \n‐compressdepot ‐console \nNote:  SAS recommends that you use the ‐console command line with ‐compressdepot in order that \nyou can see the progress of the optimization. The ‐console command is not supported on Microsoft \nWindows or Microsoft Windows for x64 so those users will not see a console progress indicator. \nExample \nsetup.sh ‐compressdepot ‐console \nVerifying an Optimized Depot \nIf you optimize your depot, you may wish to verify any number of elements of that depot: \n• \ntotal number of files found in a depot  \n• \nlist of files found and their directory path(s)  \n• \nlist and total of the files missing from the depot and shows the paths where the missing files \nshould be found \n• \nlist and total of the orders found \n• \nlist and total of the SAS installation data files found \n• \nlist of the files that are the wrong size and specifies their incorrect and correct sizes \n• \nlist of the files where checksums are incorrect and specifies their correct and incorrect \nchecksums \nThis information can be gathered by using the SAS Software Depot Check Utility described in \n“Chapter 9 — Additional Tools” below.  \nSpecifying Different SASUSER and WORK Directories (Windows and UNIX \nonly) \nSASUSER \nSASUSER is a SAS library where users store permanent SAS data sets, catalogs, preferences, profile \ninformation, and changes to ODS templates. By default, SASUSER is Documents\\My SAS \nFiles\\9.4 on Windows and ~/sasuser.v94 on UNIX. If you would like to change the location \nthat is used for SASUSER, you should use the ‐sasuser command line option. Note that the path \nyou use in the command line option must already exist or the deployment will revert to the default \nvalue with a warning message. \n \n \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n25 \nUsage \nsetup.exe ‐sasuser \"<existing directory path>\" \nExamples \nsetup.exe ‐sasuser \"C:\\SASFILES\\!USERNAME \" (Windows) \nsetup.sh ‐sasuser \"~/sasfiles\" (UNIX) \nNote that, for Windows, you can use the variable !USERNAME  in the directory path for a user that \nwill be running SAS Foundation after the deployment. If you use the !USERNAME  variable, the SAS \nDeployment Wizard will not validate the directory path, but at start-up, SAS Foundation will create \nthe specified path and make it usable. For example, suppose you use  ‐sasuser \nC:\\SASFILES\\!USERNAME but C:\\SASFILES does not exist. At start-up, SAS Foundation will \ncreate the path C:\\SASFILES\\<user ID of the person who starts SAS Foundation>.  \nWORK \nWORK is the work directory where temporary processes are run. By default, WORK is \nC:\\temp\\SAS Temporary Files on Windows and the directory that the JVM sets, usually /tmp, \non UNIX. If you would like to change the location that is used for WORK, you should use the ‐work \ncommand line option. Note that the path you use in the command line option must already exist or \nthe deployment will revert to the default value with a warning message. \nUsage \nsetup.exe ‐work \"<existing directory path>\" \nExamples \nsetup.exe ‐work \"C:\\SASWORK\\!USERNAME \" (Windows) \nsetup.sh ‐work \"~/saswork\" (UNIX) \nNote that, for Windows, you can use the variable !USERNAME  in the directory path for a user that \nwill be running SAS Foundation after the deployment. If you use the !USERNAME  variable, the SAS \nDeployment Wizard will not validate the directory path, but at start-up, SAS Foundation will create \nthe specified path and make it usable. For example, suppose you use  ‐work \nC:\\SASWORK\\!USERNAME but C:\\SASWORK does not exist. At start-up, SAS Foundation will create \nthe path C:\\SASWORK\\<user ID of the person who starts SAS Foundation>. \nSubsetting an Order without SAS Foundation \nIf you choose to move or copy a depot, additional dialogs allow you to subset the orders in the depot \nbeing considered, so that only a part is moved or copied (see “Moving Between Shared Networked \nLocations” section above). One of the ways you can subset the order being moved is “by Foundation \nproduct”; that is, by SAS products usually installed on a server, such as SAS/GRAPH and SAS/STAT. \nThe ‐subsetclients command line changes that dialog so that you can subset by client products \nthat are not configurable, such as SAS Enterprise Guide and SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office. If you \nuse the ‐subsetclients command line, the “by Foundation product” choice becomes “by \nproduct.” Also, note that if you use this command line, only non-configurable client software will be \nlisted in this dialog. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n26 \nNote:  As of SAS 9.4 (TS1M1), Rev. 940_14w19, ‐subsetclients will always also include SAS \nManagement Console. \nUsage \n‐subsetclients \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐subsetclients \nSubsetting an Order with SAS Foundation \nYou can also subset an order to include both SAS Foundation products and the non-configurable \nclients described above by using the ‐subsetnonconfig command line. If you use the  \n‐subsetnonconfig command line, the “by Foundation product” choice becomes “by product.”  \nUsage \n‐subsetnonconfig \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐subsetnonconfig \nCreating a Report of Subsetted Products \nIf you intend to subset an order using either command line options or the dialogs in the SAS \nDeployment Wizard, you may also want to create a report of what products were included and \nexcluded from the resulting subsetted order. To create this report, use the command line ‐\nlistdepot when you start the SAS Deployment Wizard. The following is an example of what that \nreport might look like: \n \nDate: 2011 Sep 25 10:02:56 \nDepot: /SASHOME \n \nOrder: 099SPS \n+ Base SAS [base__93ts1m0__mvs__ne__sp0__1] \n+ Base SAS [base__93ts1m0__mvs__w0__sp0__1] \n+ Base SAS Help and Documentation [basedoc__93110__prt__xx__sp0__1] \n+ Base SAS JAR Files [basejars__93110__prt__xx__sp0__1] \n<...> \n \nOrder: 099SQ2_2011-07-19-12.27.01 \n+ Advanced Analytics Common Components [aacomp__93110__wx6__en__sp0__1] \n+ DATA Step to DS2 Translator [accelmva__93160__wx6__en__sp0__1] \n+ Microsoft Office Access Database Engine 2010 \n[ace__93112__prt__xx__sp0__1] \n- SAS/GRAPH ActiveX Control [activexgraph__93230__win__de__sp0__1] \n+ SAS/GRAPH ActiveX Control [activexgraph__93230__win__en__sp0__1] \n- SAS/GRAPH ActiveX Control [activexgraph__93230__win__es__sp0__1] \n \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n27 \nThe Date field describes when the report was created. The Depot field describes the location where \nthe subsetted order has been placed by the SAS Deployment Wizard. The Order field gives the order \nnumber for the original order being subsetted. \n \nIn the list of products, a + symbol indicates that the product was in the original order and is included \nin the subsetted order in the location named in the Depot field. A – symbol indicates the product was \nincluded in the original order and has not been included in the subsetted order. \nUsage \n‐listdepot <location to create report>\\<output file name> \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐listdepot \"C:\\temp\\SASDepotList.txt\" \nCreating an Alternate Temporary Directory \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard runs from a temporary directory that it creates and then removes upon \ncompleting its run. If you are concerned that the temp space might be too small for the SAS \nDeployment Wizard to run, you can use the ‐templocation command line option to specify a \ntemporary directory of your choosing. \nUsage \n‐templocation <directory location> \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐templocation \"C:\\temp\\SDW\" \n \nNote:  When the SAS Deployment Wizard closes, it will delete the temporary directory and all its contents. \nWhen you select a temporary directory, ensure there is nothing already in that location that you \ncannot afford to have deleted. \nUpdating Product Documentation \nBeginning with SAS 9.4 maintenance 2, the SAS Deployment Wizard enables you to install only \nnewly released documentation, such as help files. The wizard skips all SAS product maintenance \nupdates which have occurred after your original order and installs updates to your SAS product \ndocumentation only.  \nNote:  While the ‐docupdate command line option became available with SAS 9.4 maintenance 2, it will \nonly be used initially with a few products and will increase in scope over the life of SAS 9.4.  \nUsage \n‐docupdate  \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐docupdate \n \nNote:  Using the ‐docupdate command line with the SAS Deployment Wizard only installs the updated \nproduct documentation. After the installation is complete, you must run the SAS Deployment \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n28 \nManager, selecting the Rebuild Web Applications task (see page 43) and then again using the \nDeploy Web Applications task (see page 43).  \nHelp with Command Lines \nTo see a useful list of command line options that can be used with the SAS Deployment Wizard, use  \n‐help. This command line option will open a message window describing other command line \noptions without actually starting the SAS Deployment Wizard. \nUsage \n‐help \nExample \nsetup.exe ‐help \n \nPage 29 \n \nChapter 4 — Finding and Applying Hot Fixes \n \nThere are two methods for determining what hot fixes are available for your software and applying \nthem, during the installation of your software and as a process outside of installation. This chapter is \ndivided into sections that describe both processes. \nApplying Hot Fixes with the Initial Installation (Prior to the Fifth Maintenance \nRelease of SAS 9.4) \nWhen you first install your software into a clean SASHOME, the SAS Deployment Wizard will also \ninstall any hot fixes included in the order. Orders that are downloaded include hot fixes selected by \nSAS as being appropriate for the SAS Deployment Wizard to install during a deployment.  \nNote:  Orders received on media do not initially include hot fixes.  \nFor both kinds of order delivery, download or media, when you are ready to install your software, \nyou can refresh the hot fixes you already have and retrieve new hot fixes that are appropriate to \ninstall with a dialog in the SAS Deployment Wizard (select the Manage this SAS Software Depot \ntask at the Select Deployment Task page, then Retrieve Hot Fixes).  \nNote:  When you are retrieving hot fixes, you must use the user ID that was used to create the depot. \nIn situations where time has passed between the download and the initial installation, SAS \nrecommends that you refresh the hot fixes using the process described in the paragraph above before \nthat initial installation. In order to get the latest hot fixes, the SAS Deployment Wizard must have \nInternet access.  \nNote:  To get the latest hot fixes for an order that arrives on media, you must first create a SAS Software \nDepot, then retrieve the hot fixes as described above. \nHot fixes can only be installed using this method when software is first installed into a clean \nSASHOME. After software has been installed in a SASHOME, you will have to use the method \ndescribed below. Additional software added to a SASHOME after the initial installation will not have \ndownloaded hot fixes installed either. \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard has command line options that are specific to hot fixes, described in the \n“Hot Fixes” section (page 17) of the “SAS Deployment Wizard: Command Line Options” chapter \nabove. \nApplying Hot Fixes with Any Installation (After the Fifth Maintenance Release \nof SAS 9.4) \nWhen you install your software, the SAS Deployment Wizard will also install any hot fixes included \nin the order. Installation includes initial installation, add-on installations, and upgrades. Orders that \nare downloaded include hot fixes selected by SAS as being appropriate for the SAS Deployment \nWizard to install during a deployment.  \nNote:  Orders received on media do not initially include hot fixes.  \nFor both kinds of order delivery, download or media, when you are ready to install your software, \nyou can refresh the hot fixes you already have and retrieve new hot fixes that are appropriate to \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n30 \ninstall with a dialog in the SAS Deployment Wizard (select the Manage this SAS Software Depot \ntask at the Select Deployment Task page, then Retrieve Hot Fixes).  \nNote:  When you are retrieving hot fixes, you must use the user ID that was used to create the depot. \nIn situations where time has passed between the download and the initial installation, SAS \nrecommends that you refresh the hot fixes using the process described in the paragraph above before \nthat initial installation. In order to get the latest hot fixes, the SAS Deployment Wizard must have \nInternet access.  \nNote:  To get the latest hot fixes for an order that arrives on media, you must first create a SAS Software \nDepot, then retrieve the hot fixes as described above. \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard has command line options that are specific to hot fixes, described in the \n“Hot Fixes” section (page 17) of the “SAS Deployment Wizard: Command Line Options” chapter \nabove. \nApplying Hot Fixes after the Installation \nFinding Applicable Hot Fixes \nThe hot fixes that are included in your order are those that SAS feels can be safely applied with your \ninstallation. There may be more hot fixes that should only be applied after installation is complete, or \nafter using the software for a while, you may want to determine what new hot fixes are available for \nyour software.  \nSAS Technical Support has created an application, the SAS Hot Fix Analysis, Download and \nDeployment Tool to evaluate your software deployment and generate a report that includes \ninformation and links to hot fixes that are available for your software. The SAS Hot Fix Analysis, \nDownload and Deployment Tool is available at \nhttp://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/hotfix/HF2/SASHFADD.html. Be sure to read the \nusage guide, available at the same location, before downloading and using the tool. \nApplying Hot Fixes \nWhen you have downloaded the hot fixes you need, you should apply them to your SAS software \nwith the SAS Deployment Manager. If you are interested in quiet installation of hot fixes, you must \nuse the command line options described below. \nThe SAS Deployment Manager is located in your SASHOME, in the\\SASDeploymentManager\\9.4 \nfolder.  \nBefore you begin, ensure that you are logged on with the same user ID that was used to install the \nsoftware. Ensure that SAS services and processes have been halted. In addition, since you are about \nto make changes to a working deployment, you may want to back up your installation before \napplying the hot fixes. \n1. Based on your operating system, perform the following step to start the SAS Deployment \nManager: \n• \nWindows users should double-click sasdm.exe (if your Windows operating system is \nWindows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008, you may have to right-click \nsasdm.exe and select Run as administrator). \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n31 \n• \nUNIX users should execute sasdm.sh. \n• \nz/OS users should execute sasdm.rexx. In SAS 9.4, the metadata server runs only in 64-\nbit mode, so if you are running the metadata server as a 64-bit application, you should \nadd the ‐z64 command line option. \n2. After starting the SAS Deployment Manager, the Choose Language page opens. Choose the \nlanguage in which you want to perform the configuration of your downloaded software. \nClick OK. \n3. The Select SAS Deployment Manager Task page opens. Under Administration Tasks, select \nApply Hot Fixes. Click Next to continue. \n4. The Apply Hot Fixes page opens. Select whether you want to Install SAS hot fix, Configure \nSAS hot fix, or both. In order to configure SAS hot fixes, you must either have already \napplied configurable hot fixes or have selected Install SAS hot fix. If you select Install SAS \nhot fix, type the location of the hot fix package that you have downloaded into the text box or \nuse Browse to search for the hot fix package. When you have made your selection (and \nentered the location in the text box if needed), click Start to continue. \n5. The Checking System page opens while the SAS Deployment Manager checks for enough \ndisk space and for locked files. If any files are listed in this window, follow the instructions \non the page. If there are no files listed, or after any that were listed have been addressed, click \nNext to continue. \n6. The Review Hot Fix Updates page opens, describing the hot fixes that are about to be \napplied. Click Next to continue. \n7. If you chose to Configure SAS hot fix in step 4, the Select Configuration Directory/Level \npage opens. On this page, you can choose to Select Configuration Directory from a list that \nthe SAS Deployment Manager builds. This pane is populated with configuration directories \nand levels that have been previously configured. Note that if a configuration directory has \nmore than one level, it will be listed multiple times, once for each level the directory has. \nSelect the configuration directory and level by highlighting it. \nYou can also choose to Enter Configuration Directory and Level in order to specify the \nconfiguration directory manually. You may either enter the location of the directory by hand \ninto the Configuration Directory text box or click Browse to search for a directory. When \nyou have entered the directory location, use the Configuration Level select list to specify the \nconfiguration level you wish to work with. \nNote:  \nYou should perform this full set of procedures once for every configuration directory in order \nto configure the hot fix before using the updated services. For each configuration directory \nafter the initial one, you should select only Configure SAS hot fix in step 4. \nWhen you have specified the location of the configuration directory and its level, click Next \nto continue. \n8. If you chose to Configure SAS hot fix in step 4, the Specify Connection Information page \nopens. Enter a user ID and password for the metadata server that is being used for this \nconfiguration directory and level. The SAS Deployment Manager will try to fill in the Host \nand Port text boxes based on your configuration properties file. Enter the appropriate \ninformation in the User ID and Password fields (and the Host and Port fields if necessary).  \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n32 \nWhen the information is correct, click Next to continue. \n9. If you chose to Configure SAS hot fix in step 4, the Select Product Configurations on Which \nto Apply Hot Fixes page opens. The table lists the configurations in the configuration \ndirectory and level that you specified in step 7. Both the name you have given the \nconfiguration and the SAS product it is intended for are included for ease in identification. \nThe Configured Hot Fix column shows the latest hot fix that has been configured for the \nproduct on that row. If the column reads “Not applicable” or “None configured”, then no hot \nfix has been applied to the configuration. The Available Hot Fix column lists the latest hot fix \nin the package directory (that is, available on your system) that can be applied to the \nconfiguration. If this column lists “Not applicable”, then there is no new hot fix available on \nyour system for the configuration in that row.  \nNote:  If the Available Hot Fix column has a status of “Not applicable”, this does not mean that \nthere are no hot fixes for this product available at all. Instead, it means that there are no hot \nfixes available for this product in the hot fix directory you designated in step 4. If you think \nyou should have a hot fix for a product and cannot find it, you should either go back to step 4 \nand enter a different directory location or return to the hot fix download page and download \nthe correct hot fixes. Be aware that hot fixes requiring configuration are not common, so do \nnot be alarmed if your hot fixes do not need to be configured. \nIf the Available Hot Fix column has a hot fix listed in it, then the Status column describes the \ncondition of that hot fix. “Up to date” indicates that the latest hot fix has been configured. \nYou should not configure hot fixes that are up to date again unless specifically directed to by \nSAS Technical Support. “Ready to configure” means that there is a newer hot fix than the one \nlisted in the Configured Hot Fix column and it can be configured by this task. \nIndicate the product configurations you wish to work with by selecting the check box beside \nthem. Clicking Select All forces check marks beside all the configurations in the list. Clicking \nClear All deselects all the configurations in the list. \nWhen you have selected the configurations you want to work with, click Next to continue. \nNote:  If you are working with software that was released prior to SAS 9.4 (TS1M3), Rev. \n940_15w29, and this page shows that no hot fixes have configuration available, return to step \n4 and clear the Configure SAS hot fix option. Hot fixes that require configuration are rare, \nso you should not be concerned if you do not have any marked on this page. \n10. If a product configuration you selected in step 9 is a web application, the Select Web \nApplications to Deploy for Hot Fix Configuration opens. (If you did not select a web \napplication, go to step 12.) The page lists all web applications that you selected in step 9 with \na check box. Select each product that you want to redeploy after the hot fix configuration is \ncomplete. When you have made your selections, click Next to continue. \n11. If a web application you selected in step 10 is running, the Stopping Application Server \nWarning page opens. (If no selected web application is running, the SAS Deployment \nManager will go to step 12.) Select the Allow the application server to stop option to permit \nthe SAS Deployment Manager to stop the application server. If you do not select this option, \nyou will be unable to proceed any further in this procedure. After you have selected the \noption, click Next to continue. \n12. The Deployment Summary page opens, listing the steps that the SAS Deployment Manager \nis about to take. Click Start to begin performing the listed tasks. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n33 \n13. A window opens showing that the SAS Deployment Manager is applying your hot fixes. \nWhen the tasks are complete, click Next. \n14. The Hot Fix Updates Complete page opens, describing what has been applied and providing \nlogs for any hot fixes that were configured. Click Next to continue. \n15. The Additional Resources page opens, listing links to important documentation about \ndeploying SAS software. Click Finish to close the SAS Deployment Manager.  \n16. If you configured any hot fixes, an HTML page opens that describes the location of the logs \nand any additional manual configuration steps that are required. You should perform any \nmanual steps that are listed before attempting to run the software that has just been updated. \nCommand Line Options for Hot Fixes \nThere are a number of command line options that may be used with the SAS Deployment Manager.  \n‐reinstallhotfix \nBy default, after the SAS Deployment Manager installs a hot fix on a machine, the deployment \nregistry is updated to indicate the inclusion of that hot fix. On subsequent uses of the SAS \nDeployment Manager, hot fixes are checked against the deployment registry so that previously \ninstalled hot fixes are not reinstalled. If you want the SAS Deployment Manager to ignore that \nhot fixes have already been installed on a machine and include them in another installation pass, \nuse the ‐reinstallhotfix command line option. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n34 \nExample \nsasdm.exe ‐reinstallhotfix \n‐skipusercheck \nThe hot fix installer performs a check to ensure that the user ID that performed the initial \ndeployment is also the user ID applying the hot fixes. The ‐skipusercheck command line \nforces the hot fix installer to skip that check so that another user ID maybe used. Note that the \nlogged in user should have the same permissions as the user that performed the deployment, \notherwise permission conflicts may arise. However, if permissions are set appropriately, a \ndifferent user can update files installed under a different user ID. \nOn UNIX, note that the ownership of the entire SAS tree must be changed to the new installer ID \nby issuing a command such as  \nchown ‐Rh <new_userid>:<group> <SASHOME> \nExample \nsasdm.exe ‐skipusercheck \nOn z/OS, when using UNIX System Services, the ownership of the entire SAS tree also must be \nchanged to the new installer ID by issuing a command such as  \nchown ‐Rh <new_userid>:<group> <SASHOME> \nThe user ID installing the hot fix must have the authority to create new data sets with the same \nhigh-level qualifier as the existing installation and modify the existing data sets. Also, if the  \n‐nojubsubmit command line option (described below) is not used, the hot fix installer \nautomatically runs the install jobs under the original installer ID, based on data (such as jobcards \nand user ID) stored in the install.properties file. \nExample \nsasdm.rexx ‐skipusercheck \n‐hotfixdir \nBy default, the launcher script will look for the hot fixes in \n<SASHOME>/InstallMisc/HotFixes/New. ‐hotfixdir allows you to specify a different \ndirectory as the default location for the hot fixes. ‐hotfixdir must be followed by a directory \npath to the hot fixes that you wish to apply. \nExample \nsasdm.exe ‐hotfixdir \"C:\\Downloads\\HotFix\" \nNote:  If you install multiple hot fixes on a z/OS machine, all hot fixes will be installed to a set of staging \nhot fix libraries incorporating the name of the first alphanumeric value of the hot fixes. For \nexample, if there are two hot fixes named A01 and B06, the staging name will be A01 with the \ncontents of both A01 and B06 included in that image. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n35 \n‐console (UNIX only) \nNote:  Beginning with SAS 9.4, console mode is the default for using the SAS Deployment Wizard on \nz/OS. \nIf you do not wish to rely on an X11 server for UNIX, you can use the SAS Deployment Manager \nin console mode, allowing you to use a headless system to install hot fixes. Console mode cannot \nbe used on your middle tier.  If you use console mode, each dialog used in the deployment of \nyour SAS software is represented in text. \nNote:  If you are instructed to enter a sequence that includes angle brackets, such as “Enter <q> to \nquit”, you must include those symbols. \nThe ‐console command line option also supports two options to specify the size of the output \nof the SAS Deployment Manager. Use ‐pagesize # to specify the number of lines to display \nbefore pausing the output and ‐pagewidth # to specify the number of characters to display on a \nline before wrapping to another line. Note that ‐pagesize and ‐pagewidth will not work with \nany other command line option. \nUsage \n‐console [‐pagesize #] [‐pagewidth #] \nExample \nsasdm.sh ‐console ‐pagesize 20 ‐pagewidth 50 \n‐x11 (z/OS only) \nBy default, z/OS machines use console mode when applying hot fixes. If you are deploying hot \nfixes on a z/OS machine and have an X11 server, you can use the ‐x11 command line option to \nuse the graphic user interface that is the default for Windows and UNIX. \nExample \nsasdm.rexx ‐x11 \n‐silenthotfix (see note below) \nYou can suppress the user interface for installing hot fixes (steps 3 and following above) by \nrunning in this mode. This is especially useful for enterprise-wide deployments. Note that if you \nhave stored your hot fixes in some location other than the default \n(<SASHOME>/InstallMisc/HotFixes/New), you should also use the ‐hotfixdir option \ndescribed below to identify the location of the hot fixes. \nExample \nsasdm.exe ‐silenthotfix \nNote:  The ‐silenthotfix command line option will only install hot fixes. The SAS Deployment \nManager log will indicate if a hot fix that has been installed also requires configuration. In order to \nconfigure hot fixes silently, you must create a response file and use it with the ‐quiet option. For \nmore information about response files and the ‐quiet command line option, see the “Record and \nPlayback” section of “Chapter 7 — SAS Deployment Manager: Command Line Options”. \nThe hot fix download site described in the report created by the SAS Hot Fix Analysis, Download \nand Deployment Tool will indicate if a hot fix requires configuration. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n36 \n‐z64 (z/OS only) \nIf you are installing hot fixes for your 64-bit Metadata Server SAS software, sasdm.rexx must \nbe followed with the ‐z64 command line option. \nExample \nsasdm.rexx ‐z64 \nNote:  If your hot fixes are not in the default location, then you must indicate where the hot fix(es) you \nwish to install are located by using the ‐hotfixdir command line option described above. \n‐jobsubmit (z/OS only) \nBy default on z/OS machines, the hot fix installer will not submit batch jobs to complete the \napplication of your hot fixes, allowingyou to edit and submit the batch jobs yourself. If you use \nthe ‐jobsubmit command line option, the hot fix installer will submit batch jobs to complete the \napplication of your hot fixes. There are several reasons to not use ‐jobsubmit, including the \nfollowing: \n• \nYour site uses JES3 (not JES2) \n• \nYour FTP server is configured for JESINTERFACELEVEL=2 \n• \nThe SAS installer ID is not authorized to use FTP \n• \nYou need to make site-specific changes to the JCL or wish to review the JCL before \nsubmission \n• \nThe FTP JES interface’s requirement that the jobname be the user ID performing the \ninstall suffixed with a single letter or digit is incompatible with your site’s jobname \nrequirements \nIf none of these conditions apply at your site, you can use the ‐jobsubmit command line option. \nNote:  Beginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M4), Rev. 940_17w08, if you use the ‐jobsubmit option, the \nSAS Deployment Wizard will: \n• \nno longer prompt for the host name, user ID, and password. \n• \nallow you to use the ‐jobsubmit option with both JES2 and JES3. \n• \nuse the JES SYSOUT API (SAPI) to track the progress of each job, and in particular \ndetermine when jobs have completed. \nExample \nsasdm.rexx ‐jobsubmit \n‐hotfixupdate (z/OS only) \nBy default, hot fixes included with an order can only be installed in a clean SASHOME. If you \nwant to install hot fixes in orders after your original order, you should use the ‐hotfixupdate \ncommand line option with those subsequent orders.  \nBecause an installation that includes a metadata server on z/OS requires two passes of the SAS \nDeployment Wizard (one for 64-bit SAS software and then a second for 31-bit SAS software), if \nyou installed hot fixes during the 64-bit installation you should force the SAS Deployment \nWizard to install hot fixes during the 31-bit installation into your existing SASHOME directory.      \nUsing the ‐hotfixupdate command line option for the 31-bit install permits the 31-bit \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n37 \ninstallation into your existing SASHOME to include the 31-bit hot fixes, thereby allowing you to \navoid having to use the SAS Deployment Manager process for hot fixes in your order.  \nExample \nsasdm.rexx ‐hotfixupdate \nAdditional Notes for z/OS \n• \nIf you do not use the ‐jobsubmit option, the list of hot fix jobs to execute will be written to \nmember JOBINDEX in  <high-level-qualifier>.< hotfix id>.INSTALL.CNTL. Submit \nthe first job in the list and the entire set of HOTFIXn jobs will run automatically (each job submits \nthe next job in the chain).  \nNote:  The hot fix CNTL library cannot be opened in Edit mode after submitting the jobs. Some hot fix \njobs will need exclusive access to the CNTL library for updates. \nThe PROMOTE job is not run as part of this sequence. It should not be submitted until you are \nready to move the staged data sets into production. If you want to test the hot fixes before \npromoting them to production, you can use the JCL, CLISTs, or REXX execs created in <high-\nlevel-qualifier>.<E80002>.PROCLIB, CLIST, or SASRX, respectively. These concatenate the staged \ndata sets before the production data sets. \n• \nIf the hot fix installation created '&prefix.<hot fix number>.LIBRARY' and it contains a SASHOST, \nSASXAL, or SASXA1 module, and if you set SAS System options by assembling the DEFAULT \nOPTIONS TABLE using the BAOPTS1 member of the original CNTL data set, then you must re-\nassemble this table after applying your hot fixes. To re-assemble this table, perform the following \nsteps: \n1. Edit the BAOPTS1 member in the original CNTL data set. \n2. Change the SYSLMOD DD in all three LINK EDIT steps to point to the new <high-level-\nqualifier>.LIBRARY. \n3. Rerun BAOPTS1. \n• \nIf the hot fix installation created a &prefix.<hot fix number>.LIBRARY and you run with \nan entry point of SASLPA, then you will need to look in the unloaded library to see if any of the \nnew modules are installed in your LPA. If so, then you will need to replace them with the new \nmodules and refresh LPA. \n• \nIn the configuration guide, the modules recommended for installation in the LPA are \nSASXAL \nSABXSPL \nSABODSL \nSABXDML \nSABDS \nSABSCLL \nSABDBGM \nSABZPLH \nSABXGPH \nNote that if you use the BNDLSUFX option, you will have to rename the modules appropriately \nin your LPA. For more information about the LPA bundled configuration and information about \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n38 \nusing the BNDLSUFX option, refer to the \"Installing SAS 9.4 Foundation into the LPA/ELPA\" \nsection in the Configuration Guide for SAS 9.4 Foundation for z/OS. \nHot Fix Logs \nA hot fix installation log is created in <SASHOME>/InstallMisc/InstallLogs/<IT_date-and-\ntime-stamp>.log (for example, /sas94/InstallMisc/InstallLogs/IT_2011-07-19-\n13.54.19.log). Each attempt to install a hot fix results in the creation of a new log file with detailed \ninformation regarding the installation process. \nIn addition, hot fix installation is recorded in the SAS Deployment Registry. The deployment registry \nreport is described in detail in the “Additional Tools” chapter, on page 76. \n \n \n \nPage 39 \n \nChapter 5 — SAS Deployment Wizard: Basic Troubleshooting \nSuspending and Resuming a Deployment \nBeginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M3), Rev. 940_15w29, the SAS Deployment Wizard on Windows and \nUNIX has added a feature to allow you to exit the SAS Deployment Wizard during configuration or \ninstallation in order to remediate issues that caused a failure, and then resume where you left off \nduring your deployment. With this new feature, a deployment that has been restarted avoids having \nto go through dialogs again, with the exception of password dialogs. If you attempt to retry a \npreviously suspended deployment, the SAS Deployment Wizard will ask if you want to resume your \nprevious deployment, or start anew.  \nThere are a few caveats to consider if you decide to take advantage of this new feature. \n• \nSuspend/resume is not supported on z/OS. Support for suspend/resume on z/OS will be \nprovided in the future. \n• \nAll failed installation steps bypassed in the initial deployment will be rerun in the resumed \ndeployment, and cause the post-processing step to be rerun. \n• \nAll configuration steps bypassed in the initial deployment will be bypassed in the resumed \ndeployment as well. \n• \nThe new functionality is not intended to remediate invalid or improper dialog responses, \nsuch as an unusable port. This feature is intended only for addressing environmental issues \nkeeping the SAS Deployment Wizard from continuing. \n• \nIn order to resume a previous unfinished deployment, the same order number must be used. \n• \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard will not support suspend/resume when updating existing \ndeployments in place (update mode). Resuming from any failure will result in the SAS \nDeployment Wizard executing in update mode again to install and configure any remaining \nproducts. \nNote:  Beginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M7), Rev. 940_20w34, the SAS Deployment Wizard does \nsupport suspend/resume when updating existing deployments in place (update mode). \n• \nAll configuration steps bypassed by the user in the initial deployment will be bypassed in the \nresumed deployment as well. \n• \nYou cannot resume an unfinished deployment in silent mode. Since you must choose \nbetween resuming a failed deployment or starting again, a failed silent deployment must be \nresumed in either interactive or console mode. \n• \nIf multiple users share the same local user space, you may receive a prompt to resume \ndeployment unexpectedly due to the presence of files from another user's unfinished \ndeployment. \nSAS Deployment Wizard Stopping without Error Message \nWhen you are installing your software, the SAS Deployment Wizard may stop without generating an \nerror message. Use the following list to troubleshoot this issue: \n• \nIf you are installing from media, are the DVDs damaged? \nCheck the DVDs for scratches or smudges. Clean them with a soft cloth and try again. If the \nproblem continues, copy the entire contents of the first DVD to a new empty folder on the \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n40 \nlocal drive. If you receive errors while copying the contents of the DVD to a local folder, then \nobtain new DVDs. If the copy works, then start the setup.exe file in the new folder or try the \ninstallation on another machine. If the installation does not start on another machine, then \nobtain new DVDs. \n• \nWas SAS software previously installed on this system?  \nIf SAS software was previously installed, when you reinstall the software, be sure to close all \nSAS programs. \n• \nIs antivirus software running? \nClose and deactivate all antivirus software before starting your installation. \n• \nDoes your account have the appropriate permissions? \nFor Windows, the installer account must have Administrator rights (user must be a local \nadministrator on the machine and/or a member of the administrators group). For more \ndetails, see http://support.sas.com/kb/5/055.html. \nFor UNIX, the installer account should be the sas account. The root account should not be \nused. \n• \nAre you installing from a SAS Software Depot or from the original CDs? Retry the \ninstallation from a different media than the one from which you first attempted the \ninstallation.  \nProblems have been reported when users try to copy a SAS Software Depot from one \nmachine to another. Instead of copying the depot, use the SAS Deployment Wizard to create \na SAS Software Depot on your machine. If you have just copied the depot from one location \nto another instead of using the SAS Deployment Wizard to install SAS, try installing from the \noriginal SAS Software Depot. \nSAS Deployment Wizard Log Files \nThe SAS Deployment Wizard keeps a log of its activities, including both successful operations and \nnotes about any failures that may occur. While the information contained in those logs is probably \ntoo complex for a user to interpret, they are invaluable tools should you need to contact SAS \nTechnical Support. \nThe log files can be found, by default, in the following locations, by operating system. \nWindows \n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\SAS\\SASDeploymentWizard\\ \nor \nC:\\Users\\<userid>\\AppData\\Local\\SAS\\SASDeploymentWizard \nSome files and folders are hidden by default and you may need to change your settings to view them.  \n1. Select Organize→Folder and Search Options→View. \n2. Select Show hidden files and folders. \n3. Clear Hide extensions and Hide protected. \n \n \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n41 \nUNIX \n$HOME/.SASAppData/SASDeploymentWizard/   \nor \n~/.SASAppData of the user running the depot \nInstallation Log Files \nAs each component of your SAS Software installs, a separate log file is created with information \nabout the installation of that component. These logs are different from the SAS Deployment Wizard \nlog files, because they have more detail about each component, while the SAS Deployment Wizard \nlog file only notes the success or failure of each component installation. If you have an installation \nproblem and contact SAS Technical Support, they may ask you to check the installation logs for more \ninformation. \nThe installation logs are located at <SASHOME>\\InstallMisc\\InstallLogs. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n42 \n \n \n \nPage 43 \n \nChapter 6 — SAS Deployment Manager Tasks \nThe SAS Deployment Manager is a tool that is included with each SAS software order. It allows you \nto perform some administrative and configuration tasks. The SAS Deployment Manager is located in \nyour SASHOME, in the \\SASDeploymentManager\\9.4 folder.  \nBefore you begin, ensure that you are logged on with the same user ID that was used to install the \nsoftware. Based on your operating system, perform the following step to start the SAS Deployment \nManager: \n• \nWindows users should double-click sasdm.exe (depending on your settings, you may have \nto right-click the sasadm.exe and select Run as administrator). \n• \nUNIX users should execute sasdm.sh. \n• \nz/OS users should execute sasdm.rexx. If you are using 64-bit z/OS, you should add a \ncommand line option, ‐z64. \nThe following sections describe the SAS Deployment Manager tasks and how to perform them. In \nsome cases, the tasks may be associated with planned deployments, so references to the appropriate \ndocumentation for those tasks are also listed below. \nAdministration Tasks \nUpdate Passwords \nChoose this option to update passwords for selected users in an existing configuration. For more \ninformation, refer to the “Update a Managed Password” topic in the SAS 9.4 Intelligence Platform \nSecurity Administration Guide located at \nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \nRebuild Web Applications \nChoose this option to rebuild web applications previously configured in an existing configuration. \nFor more information, refer to the” Rebuilding the SAS Web Applications” topic in the SAS 9.4 \nIntelligence Platform: Middle-Tier Administration Guide located at \nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \nDeploy Web Applications \nChoose this option to deploy web applications previously configured in an existing configuration. \nFor more information, refer to the “Redeploying the SAS Web Applications” topic in the SAS 9.4 \nIntelligence Platform: Middle-Tier Administration Guide located at \nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \nRemove Existing Configuration \nChoose this option to remove configuration content for an existing configuration. Installed products \nwill not be removed. For more information, refer to the “Removing a SAS Configuration” topic in the \nSAS 9.4 Intelligence Platform: Installation and Configuration Guide located at \nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n44 \nUpdate SID File in Metadata (Windows and UNIX only) \nChoose this option to update the SID file in metadata to license SAS middle-tier products.  SAS \nFoundation software is not affected by this option. For more information, refer to the Software License \nRenewal Instructions—SAS 9.4 for Microsoft Windows and Windows for x64 Planned Deployment at \nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/installcenter/en/ikwinplannedri/66607\n/PDF/default/setinit_planned.pdf or the Software License Renewal Instructions—SAS 9.4 for \nUNIX Environments Planned Deployment at \nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/installcenter/en/ikunixplannedri/6661\n0/PDF/default/setinit_planned.pdf. \nManage SAS File Types (Windows only) \nChoose this option on Windows in order to manage the products associated with various file types. \nThis option will only be available if there are installed products that use file type associations. \n1. After starting the SAS Deployment Manager, the Choose Language page opens. Choose the \nlanguage in which you want to view the SAS Deployment Manager. Click OK. \n2. The Select SAS Deployment Manager Task page opens. Under Administration Tasks, select \nManage SAS File Types. Click Next to continue. \n3. The Default Product for SAS File Types page opens. The left-hand column lists the file \nextensions for files in your SASHOME that can be opened with more than one SAS product. \nThe right-hand column describes what types of files use those extensions. Beneath the table is \na list of the software installed in your SASHOME that can be selected as the default product \nfor those file types. Select which product should become the default for the file extensions \nthat are listed or select Advanced in order to assign a default SAS application to each file \ntype. When you have made a selection, click Next to continue. \n4. If you selected Advanced in step 3, the Manage SAS File Extensions page opens. If you did \nnot select Advanced, go to step 5. \nThe Manage SAS File Extensions page consists of a table. The left-hand column lists file \nextensions that can be opened by more than one SAS product. The right-hand column lists \nthe products currently assigned as the default product (SAS or third-party) for that file \nextension.  To change the default product for a file type, use the drop-down menu to select \nanother product.  \nNote  \nIf you use the Manage SAS File Types task for an extension that is currently associated with \na third-party product to a SAS product, several things will happen: \n• \nThe association to the third-party product will be reset to use the chosen SAS product but the \nchanges will take affect only for the user who is running the SAS Deployment Manager. All \nother users will continue to see the extension associated with the third-party product. \n• \nThe third-party product will no longer be displayed as a selection in future invocations of the \nSAS Deployment Manager unless the user re-associates the extension to another third party \nproduct using Windows tools.    \nWhile you can use this task to reset an extension currently associated with a third-party product \nto a SAS product, the reverse is not true. You cannot use this task to reassign an extension \nassociation from a SAS product to a third-party product. \nWhen you have selected a default product for each file extension, click Next to continue. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n45 \n5. The Default Product Changes Summary page opens. The first column, File Extension, lists \nthe file extensions are being updated. The second column, Old Product, shows what \napplication is currently the default product associated with that file type, while the third \ncolumn, New Product, lists what you have selected as the new default product. Review your \nselections, using Back to go back and make more changes as needed. When the page \ndescribes the changes you want to make, click Next to continue. \n6. The File Type Associations Complete page describes the changes that have been made. Click \nFinish to close the SAS Deployment Manager. \nUpdate Host Name References \nChoose this option to update host name references in an existing configuration. For more \ninformation, refer to the “Using the SAS Deployment Manager to Update Host Name References” \ntopic in the SAS 9.4 Intelligence Platform: System Administration Guide located at \nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \nApply Hot Fixes \nFor information about how to find hot fixes and install them using the SAS Deployment Manager, see \nthe “Applying Hot Fixes” section on page 30. \nUpdate Existing Configuration \nChoose this option to configure SAS products that have been updated or upgraded. For more \ninformation, refer to the “Configure Updated or Upgraded SAS Products” section of the SAS 9.4 \nIntelligence Platform: Installation and Configuration Guide, located at \nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \nSpecify New Passphrase \nChoose this option in order to modify the passphrase used to encrypt your passwords. This provides \na thorough, secure, and efficient approach for an unrestricted user to address situations such as the \nfollowing:  \n• \nFor greater security, you want to re-encrypt stored passwords using a passphrase as the \nencryption key, instead of using the default fixed key.  \n• \nYou suspect one or more stored passwords have been compromised, so you want to re-\nencrypt using a new passphrase.  \n• \nYou have upgraded the encryption type with which new or updated passwords are stored, \nand you also want to upgrade the format of currently-stored passwords.  \n• \nYou are preparing to discontinue use of SAS/SECURE, so you must downgrade the format of \ncurrently-stored passwords.  \nCaution:  \nWhen you introduce, change, or clear a passphrase, all passwords in login objects within the \nspecified metadata server are affected.  \nFor more information, refer to the “How to Re-Encrypt Stored Passwords” topic in the SAS 9.4 \nIntelligence Platform Security Administration Guide located at \nhttp://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n46 \nChange Locale and Region Settings (Windows and UNIX only) \nUse this option to change the locale and region settings for your SAS software. These settings control \nhow SAS software displays text, numbers, currencies, and date and time values. \n1. After starting the SAS Deployment Manager, the Choose Language page opens. Choose the \nlanguage in which you want to perform the configuration of your software. Click OK. \n2. The Select SAS Deployment Manager Task page opens. Under Administration Tasks, select \nLocale Setup Manager. Click Next to continue. \n3. The Locale Setup Manager page opens. Select the region and locale setting you wish to use \nfrom the Language list. Then, in the lower pane, select the products you wish to apply the \nnew settings to. You can use Select All to choose every product and Clear All to remove the \nselection from every product. When the correct setting and products are selected, click Next \nto continue. \nNote:  If you have configured the machine you are working with as a Unicode server, you cannot \nchange the default language for SAS Foundation. \n4. The Summary page describes the changes that have been made, including the region and \nlocale selected and the products affected. Click Finish to close the SAS Deployment Manager. \nThere are a few caveats to using the tool to change the region settings: \n• \nIf you change your region setting so that it requires the encoding to change for SAS \nFoundation, you will get a warning but be allowed to continue. If SAS Foundation is used as \na server in a planned/configured deployment, you will need to create a new configuration to \ninclude the new setting. \n• \nSpecifying a region setting that requires loading a different sasv9.cfg file for another \nlanguage will change the default language for SAS Foundation. If a supporting language is \nnot installed for the selected regional setting change, one of the following will happen. \no \nIf the regional setting is for a SBCS language, then English will be the default language. \no \nIf the regional setting is for a DBCS language, then English with DBCS will be the default \nlanguage. \n• \nThe deployment registry will reflect the regional settings change only if you change the \nregional settings for all Java products as well as SAS Foundation. \nConfigure Autoload Directory for SAS Visual Analytics  \nUse this option to set up autoload for SAS Visual Analytics.

Click Finish to exit the SAS Deployment Manager. \nManage Trusted CA Bundle  \nNote:  Security and certification processes can be highly technical. You should not perform any of the tasks \ndescribed below without a solid understanding of security procedures. Inappropriate changes can have \nextremely harmful effects on not only your SAS software, but any software that you are using. \nCertificates are used to authenticate a server process or a human user. A certificate authority (CA) is \nan authority in a network that issues and manages security credentials and public keys for message \nencryption. As part of a public key infrastructure (PKI), a CA checks with a registration authority to \nverify information provided by the requestor of a digital certificate. If the registration authority \nverifies the requestor's information, the CA can then issue a certificate. The large collection of public \nCA certificates (Root and Intermediate levels), for all commercial Certificate Authorities, that may be \nused to digitally sign our customers’ private identity certificates is referred to as the Trusted CA \nBundle. Customers may maintain their own internal Certificate Authority and may need to add their \nCA's public certificate(s) to the Trusted CA Bundle provided by SAS. \nBeginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M3), Rev. 940_15w29, the SAS Deployment Manager includes tools that \nallow you to add certificates to the trusted CA bundle manually and also to remove any that you \nhave added. Procedures to use those tools are described in the sections below. \nThe trusted CA bundle that SAS redistributes is from Mozilla, and the list of included root CAs can \nbe found at https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:IncludedCAs. The trusted CA bundle is provided \nin multiple formats, for use in different SAS \"SSL Client\" contexts.  There is a text file format, with \nbase64 encoded contents (also known as PEM format) for use by SAS Foundation servers (for \nexample, metadata server or Workspace Server) and identified using the SSLCALISTLOC option. It is \nalso provided in a JKS keystore archive format for use by all SAS Java applications through a \nkeystore file (also known as a truststore when it does not contain private key entries) called \njssecacerts. The two SAS Deployment Manager tasks described below update both those files. \nThese tasks must be used when your security framework includes self-signed or site-signed CA \ncertificates or client CA certificates. Certificate management must be performed on each machine in a \ndeployment. \nOn Windows and UNIX, the jssecacerts file is placed into the SAS Private JRE in the \nSASHOME\\SASPrivateJavaRuntimeEnvironment\\9.4\\jre\\lib\\security directory. The \njssecacerts file is managed directly by the tasks and should not be updated or changed manually. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n64 \nWe do not support a private JRE on z/OS, so there is no jssecacerts file on z/OS. On z/OS, SAS \nwill create a JKS truststore, but it is only needed if you are running Java applications from USS. \nIf you are upgrading from an earlier 9.4 release to 9.4M3, any self-signed or site-signed CA \ncertificates that have previously been added to the SAS Private JRE’s cacerts file manually must \nalso be added to the new trusted CA bundle using the Add Certificate task, described below. This \nshould be repeated for each machine in the deployment. \nAdd Certificate to Trusted CA Bundle  \nThe SAS Deployment Manager can add certificates either individually or as a chain of trust list. In \neither case, they must be X.509 certificates, formatted in Base-64 encoding (ASCII), with .pem, .crt, \nor .cer extensions. For more information about creating the chain of trust list, see “Creating a CA \nChain of Trust File” below. \nUse the following steps to add a certificate: \n1. After starting the SAS Deployment Manager, the Choose Language page opens. Choose the \nlanguage in which you want to perform the configuration of your software. Click OK. \n2. The Select SAS Deployment Manager Task page opens. Under Manage Trusted CA Bundle, \nselect Add Certificate to Trusted CA Bundle. Click Next to continue. \n3. The Specify Certificate to Add page opens. Type the location of the certificate or chain of \ntrust file you want to add to your trusted CA bundle in the text box. You can also use Browse \nin order to search for the certificate. The Distinguished Name defined within each certificate \nwill be used as the alias within the truststore. \nWhen you have specified a certificate to be added, click Next to continue. \n4. The Summary page opens, describing the action that is about to be taken. Click Start to \ncomplete the task. \n5. The In Progress page opens, indicating that the task has been started. When the SAS \nDeployment Manager is finished, the Deployment Complete page opens. Click Finish to exit \nthe SAS Deployment Manager. \nAfter the task has been completed, a log describing the actions that were taken is placed in \n<SASHOME>\\InstallMisc\\InstallLogs, with a file name that begins with “certframe”. \nCreating a CA Chain of Trust File \nIf you are only adding one certificate, creating a chain of trust file is inappropriate, and you should \njust point the SAS Deployment Manager to that certificate. If you have multiple certificates, you can \ncopy and paste the contents of all the certificates to be trusted into a new file. These CAs can be \nprimary, intermediate, or root certificates.  \nTo manually create a new trust list, use the following template:  \n(your intermediate certificate[s])  \n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \n<base64 encoded certificate> \n-----END CERTIFICATE----- \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n65 \n \n(your root CA certificate) \n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \n<base64 encoded certificate> \n-----END CERTIFICATE----- \nThe issuer of your server certificates, your intermediate CA certificate, should be the first in the file. \nThe certificates that follow should be ordered such that the issuer of one certificate is the subject of \nthe following one and so on until you get to the root CA certificate. The root CA certificate should be \nthe last certificate in the file. \nThe content of the certificate in this example is represented as <PEM encoded certificate>. The \ncontent of each certificate is delimited with a -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END \nCERTIFICATE----- pair. All text outside the delimiters is ignored. Therefore, you might not want \nto use delimited lines for descriptive comments.  \nThe file can be saved with any name, but it must have a .pem extension. \nRemove Certificate from Trusted CA Bundle  \nThe SAS Deployment Manager can remove certificates either individually or as a chain of trust list. In \norder to remove customer certificates from the trusted CA bundle, you must have the permissions \nnecessary to access the truststore location and delete the certificate file. Only certificates that have \nbeen added with the SAS Deployment Manager Add Certificate to Trusted CA Bundle task can be \nremoved in this way. \nIf you remove certificates individually, you should not remove any intermediate certificates from a \nchain of trust without either replacing them with another certificate or removing the chain entirely. \nUse the following steps to remove a certificate: \n1. After starting the SAS Deployment Manager, the Choose Language page opens. Choose the \nlanguage in which you want to perform the configuration of your software. Click OK. \n2. The Select SAS Deployment Manager Task page opens. Under Manage Trusted CA Bundle, \nselect Remove Certificate from Trusted CA Bundle. Click Next to continue. \n3. The Specify Certificate to Be Removed page opens. Click on Browse in order to search for \nthe certificate you want to delete.  \nNote:  You cannot type the location of the certificate; you must use the Browse function. \nWhen you have specified a certificate to be deleted, click Next to continue. \n4. The Summary page opens, describing the action that is about to be taken. Click Start to \ncomplete the task. \n5. The In Progress page opens, indicating that the task has been started. When the SAS \nDeployment Manager is finished, the Deployment Complete page opens. Click Finish to exit \nthe SAS Deployment Manager. \nAfter the task has been completed, a log describing the actions that were taken is placed in \n<SASHOME>\\InstallMisc\\InstallLogs, with a file name that begins with “certframe”. \n \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n66 \n \n \nPage 67 \n \nChapter 7 — SAS Deployment Manager: Command Line \nOptions \nThis chapter contains command line options that can be used with the SAS Deployment Manager, \nincluding those required for a quiet removal of your SAS software. \nQuiet Deployment \nA quiet deployment allows you to provide all of the responses that would normally be supplied to \nthe SAS Deployment Manager when running interactively, but without the presence of a user. It is \nintended for use in any context that does not require a user to be present at the machine.  \nIn order to perform a quiet deployment, you should first create a response file according to the \n\"Record Mode\" section of \"Record and Playback\" below. After you have created a response file, you \nshould use the information in the \"Quiet Playback Mode\" section below to perform the quiet \ndeployment on the target machine. \nNote:  These command line options cannot be used for the quiet installation of hot fixes. If you are interested \nin quietly installing hot fixes, refer to “Chapter 4 – Finding and Applying Hot Fixes” on page 29. \nRecord and Playback \nRecord and playback is a feature in the SAS Deployment Manager that is used to save dialog \nresponses to a file and then load those responses at a later point. The SAS Deployment Manager \nprovides three different modes for record and playback. Each mode is described in detail below. \nNote that when using playback, the SAS Deployment Wizard should be at the same level of \nconfiguration prompting as was used in record mode. Manual revision of the response file should be \nattempted only with extreme caution by users with experience with SAS configuration or with the \nassistance of a SAS consultant or Technical Support. \nRecord Mode \nNote:  The response file generated with ‐record may contain passwords in plain or encrypted format. You \nshould secure the response file as you would any other sensitive information. \nRunning the SAS Deployment Manager in record mode will cause it to create a response file that \ncontains values for each of the prompts the user sees when running the SAS Deployment Manager. \nThe SAS Deployment Manager must run to completion when creating the response file in this mode. \nUsage \n‐record \nThe response file will be created in the user’s home directory on all platforms with a file name of \nsdwresponse.properties. \nThe response file location can be specified by adding an additional command line argument: \n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n68 \nNote:  If you specify a file location where a file already exists, the pre-existing file will be overwritten by the \nSAS Deployment Manager. \nExample \nsasdm.exe ‐record ‐responsefile \"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\" \nBy default, no deployment occurs when running in a record mode. In order to force a deployment \nwhile recording, use –deploy. \nNote:  If you use any other command line options while using record and playback, those options are not \nincluded in the response file. To properly use the response file, you must repeat those same command \nline options with the playback. \nQuiet Playback Mode \nUsers can suppress the user interface for the SAS Deployment Manager by running in this mode. The \nmode requires an existing response file. If the SAS Deployment Manager encounters a dialog for \nwhich there is not a valid response in the response file, a message will be recorded in the log file and \nthe SAS Deployment Manager will return an error code of -1. There is no visual feedback while the \nSAS Deployment Manager is running in this mode. SAS recommends that you check your log file \nafter the deployment to determine if any errors occurred. \nNote:  This command line option cannot be used for the quiet installation of hot fixes. If you are interested in \nquietly installing hot fixes, refer to “Chapter 4 – Finding and Applying Hot Fixes” on page 29. \nUsage \n‐quiet \nThe response file must already exist and will default to the user’s home directory on all platforms \nwith a file name of sdwresponse.properties. \nThe response file can be specified by adding an additional command line argument: \n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \n \nNote: \nBecause the response file created automatically by the SAS Deployment Wizard does not contain \nvalues for the passwords, SAS strongly recommends using the ‐quiet command line option only \nwith a response file that has been created using the ‐responsefile command line option described \nabove. \nExample \nsasdm.exe ‐quiet ‐responsefile \"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\" \nNote on Windows Usage \nWindows users also have the –wait option available for their use. The -wait option forces the \nsasdm.exe process to remain in the task list until the SAS Deployment Manager completes. The \nfollowing is an example using the –wait option: \nsasdm.exe ‐wait ‐quiet ‐responsefile \"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\" \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n69 \nPartial Prompting \nWhen running the SAS Deployment Manager in partial prompt mode, the user only sees dialogs that \ndo not have a valid response in the response file. This mode is used when the SAS Deployment \nManager resumes after being interrupted by a reboot and values originally supplied are no longer \nvalid. This can occur when mapped drives are lost after rebooting on Windows. This mode may also \nbe used by administrators to supply some of the deployment information for their users.  \nUsage  \nsasdm.exe ‐partialprompt  \nThe response file must already exist and will default to the user's home directory on all platforms \nwith a file name of sdwresponse.properties.  \nThe response file can be specified by adding an additional command line argument:  \n‐responsefile <full path to the response file>  \nExample  \nsasdm.exe ‐partialprompt ‐responsefile \"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\"  \nMonitoring the SAS Deployment Manager During Quiet Playback \nRunning the SAS Deployment Manager in quiet mode makes it more difficult to monitor the \ndeployment and to notice if errors occur. To address this concern, you can use the Task Manager on \nWindows and periodically issue the ps command on UNIX to track whether the SAS Deployment \nManager is running. \nOn Windows, specify the -wait option when invoking the SAS Deployment Manager in quiet mode \nto cause sasdm.exe to display and remain in the Windows Task Manager process list. \nFor example: \nsasdm.exe ‐quiet ‐wait ‐responsefile \"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\" \nIf you do not use -wait, monitor the process named java.exe. \nNote:  Use of network management software (such as SCCM or Tivoli) might require you to use the -wait \noption when running the SAS Deployment Manager in quiet mode in order for such software to \ndetermine when the SAS Deployment Manager finishes executing. Refer to your network management \nplatform documentation for more information.  \nAs with most processes on UNIX, issue the ps command to monitor the SAS Deployment Manager \nrunning in quiet mode. Remember that output from a ps command can be misleading because the \nprocess name returned is not always named sasdm.sh, since the actual script that the SAS \nDeployment Manager is running at any given time varies. However, the process ID remains the \nsame. \nInteractive Playback Mode \nThe response file can also be used to default all the prompts in the SAS Deployment Manager. In this \nmode, all the dialogs in the SAS Deployment Manager are displayed and the default values are \nloaded from the response file. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n70 \nNote:  Even if you are using ‐responsefile to deploy your software on a UNIX system, you must still \ndeploy a windowing environment, such as X11. Using ‐responsefile still invokes a graphical \nuser interface.  \nUsage \n‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \nExample \nsasdm.exe ‐responsefile \"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\" \nUninstall All Products \nIf you want to quietly remove all of your SAS products from your machine, you can use the ‐\nuninstallall command line with the –quiet command line. Used together, these command lines \nallow you to automate the software removal process without having to create a response file. \nUsage \n‐quiet ‐uninstallall  \nExample \nsasdm.exe ‐quiet ‐uninstallall  \nMiscellaneous Command Line Options \nConfiguring a Host Name \nNote: This SAS Deployment Manager option is new with SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_20w26. \nIf you are performing an update or upgrade, the SAS Deployment Manager must be run on the same \nhost that the original configuration was performed on. Over time, that host name might be changed, \nresulting in errors when an update is attempted. Using the -confighostname option allows you to \nchange the local host name that the SAS Deployment Manager validates against to the value in the \noption. \nUsage \n‐confighostname <host name> \nExample \n./sasdm.sh ‐confighostname hostname.companyname.com \nUsing a Text-Based Interface (UNIX only) \nNote:  Beginning with SAS 9.4, console mode is the default for using the SAS Deployment Wizard on z/OS. \nIf you do not wish to rely on an X11 server for UNIX, you can use the SAS Deployment Manager in \nconsole mode, allowing you to use a headless system to configure your server. If you use console \nmode, each dialog used in the deployment of your SAS software is represented in text. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n71 \nNote:  If you are instructed to enter a sequence that includes angle brackets, such as “Enter <q> to \nquit”, you must include those symbols. \nThe ‐console command line option can be used with other options at the same time, such as \nrecording or playing back a response file. \nThe ‐console command line option also supports two options to specify the size of the output of \nthe SAS Deployment Manager. Use ‐pagesize # to specify the number of lines to display before \npausing the output and ‐pagewidth # to specify the number of characters to display on a line \nbefore wrapping to another line. Note that ‐pagesize and ‐pagewidth will not work with any \nother command line option. \nUsage \n‐console [‐pagesize #] [‐pagewidth #] \nExample \nsasdm.sh ‐console ‐pagesize 20 ‐pagewidth 50 \nSpecifying a Graphic Interface (z/OS only) \nBy default, the SAS Deployment Manager  uses console mode when running on a z/OS machine. If \nyou are deploying your software on z/OS and have an X11 server, you can use the ‐x11 command \nline option to use the graphic user interface that is the default for Windows and UNIX. \nUsage \n‐x11 \nExample \nsasdm.rexx ‐x11 \nAutomatically submitting jobs (z/OS only) \nBy default, z/OS users must manually submit jobs. The ‐jobsubmit command line option allows \nthe SAS Deployment Manager to automatically submit jobs. \nUsage \n‐jobsubmit \nExample \nsasdm.rexx ‐jobsubmit \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n72 \n \n \n \nPage 73 \n \nChapter 8 — SAS Deployment Agent \nOverview \nThe SAS Deployment Agent works with metadata servers and therefore is only used in planned \ndeployments.  \nThe SAS Deployment Agent is a new tool in SAS 9.4 used to support configuration operations \nassociated with multi-machine mid-tier topologies and middle-tier clustering. The agent also \nfacilitates synchronizing backup and restore operations for server and middle-tier machines.  SAS \nproducts can communicate with the SAS Deployment Agent in order to run remote processes and \ncopy content over the SAS Deployment Agent connection to perform configuration management \noperations.  \nIf the agent is not used, you will be required to manually perform complex and time-consuming \nconfiguration steps for multi-machine mid-tier topologies and middle-tier clustering. In addition, you \nwill not be able to use the SAS Deployment Backup and Recovery tool for your deployment. Instead, \nyou will need to use operating system commands or third-party tools to back up and restore \nresources such as the SAS Content Server, the SAS Web Infrastructure Platform Database Server \ndatabases, and configuration files for compute servers. (You could still use the metadata server \nbackup facility to back up the metadata server, since that facility does not depend on the SAS \nDeployment Agent. For more information, see “Best Practices for Backing Up and Restoring Your \nSAS Content” in the SAS Intelligence Platform: System Administration Guide.) \nUsing the SAS Deployment Agent is not required. If you review the security considerations below \nand decide that you do not want to use the SAS Deployment Agent, there are a number of \ndeployment and configuration tasks that will have to be performed manually: \n• \nconfiguring SAS Web Infrastructure Platform \n• \nconfiguring a SAS Web Application Server cluster \n• \nstarting SAS Web Application Server and SAS Web Application Server clusters \n• \nchanging passwords on SAS Web Application Server and SAS Web Application Server \nclusters \nSecurity Considerations \nThe SAS Deployment Agent and SAS Remote Deployment Agent Client take advantage of the Java \nSecure Socket Extension (JSSE), enabling secure Internet communications. JSSE provides a framework \nand an implementation for a Java version of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and includes \nfunctionality for data encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and optional client \nauthentication. Using JSSE provides for the secure passage of data between a client and a server by \nusing keystores and truststores in order to authenticate incoming and outgoing messages.  \nDuring installation of the SAS Deployment Agent and SAS Remote Deployment Agent Client, you \nhave several options for defining how you wish to secure your communication: \n• \nDo not secure the connection should be used if you feel that a keystore and truststore are not \nrequired. You can always reconfigure the security at a later time by using the SAS \nDeployment Agent configuration tasks described below. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n74 \n• \nGenerate the credentials to secure the connection gives SAS permission to manage your \ncredentials by creating a keystore and truststore for you. The generated credentials will be \nself-signed certificates and will use the name and site number from your SAS installation \ndata file (SID file) used to license your software. The generated certificates are valid for 100 \nyears. New credentials can also be regenerated using the SAS Deployment Agent \nconfiguration tasks described in the “Manage SAS Deployment Agent Service” section of \n“Chapter 6 - SAS Deployment Manager Tasks”. \n• \nSpecify existing credentials to secure the connection allows you to use a keystore and \ntruststore that you have created using other Java tools. Note that SAS supports only the JKS \nformat for the keystore and truststore. \nAdding Services to the SAS Deployment Agent (UNIX only) \nIf the SAS Deployment Agent is installed on a Windows machine, it has services to start, stop, restart, \nand display the status of the SAS Deployment Agent. In order to have the same functionality on \nUNIX, you must add a script to the machine’s system configuration. Use the following procedure to \ncorrectly place the script.   \n1. These steps should only be performed by a user ID with root level permissions. Ensure that \nyour user ID has those permissions. \n2. Go to the SASHome/SASDeploymentAgent/9.4 directory.  \n3. Open the sas.deployd script and follow the operating system-specific instructions within \nthe comments at the beginning of the script. \n4. When those instructions have been completed, use the following command to start the \nservice: \nservice sas.deployd start \nThe stop, status, and restart commands are also supported. \nChecking the Status of the SAS Deployment Agent (UNIX only) \nAnother method for determining the status of the agent on UNIX machines is to issue the following \ncommand on the machine where the agent is running: \nagentadmin.sh stat up\n \nPage 75 \n \nChapter 9 — Additional Tools \nSAS Software Depot Check Utility \nPrior to SAS 9.4, the SAS Software Depot Check Utility did not run on z/OS machines. However, \nbeginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M2), Rev. 940_14w41, the utility will work on all supported operating \nsystems for SAS 9.4. If you are using a deployment from before SAS 9.4 (TS1M2), Rev. 940_14w41, \nyou will still have the previous version of the utility. For information about its operation, refer to \nAppendix D. \nNote:  In order to determine the revision of your software, refer to SAS note 50493, located at \nhttp://support.sas.com/kb/50/493.html \nThe SAS Software Depot Check Utility works on depots that have not been optimized as well as \ndepots that have been optimized using the ‐compressdepot command line. The utility scans a \ndepot for the following information and then provides them in a report: \n• \ntotal number of files found in a depot  \n• \nlist of files found and their directory path(s)  \n• \nlist and total of the files missing from the depot and the paths where the missing files should \nbe found \n• \nlist and total of the orders found \n• \nlist and total of the SAS installation data files found \n• \nlist of the files that are the wrong size and their incorrect and correct sizes \n• \nlist of the files where checksums are incorrect and their correct and incorrect checksums \nFollow these steps in order to use the SAS Software Depot Check Utility. \nNote:  You must execute the SAS Software Depot Checker using the user ID that created the SAS software \ndepot. \n1. Start the utility by using either of the following two methods: \nSAS Depot Check Utility executable \nYour SAS Software Depot contains an executable that will start the SAS Depot Check Utility. \nGo to the \\utilities\\depotchecker directory and execute the SASDepotCheck.XXX \nfile that is appropriate for the operating system that you are using. \n \nCommand line option \nIssue the SAS Deployment Wizard setup executable command with the ‐depotchecker \ncommand line option. For example, on UNIX, the command would be \nsetup.sh ‐depotchecker \nOn z/OS, the command would be \nsetup.rexx ‐depotchecker \n \nNote:  For z/OS, you must execute the SAS Software Depot Checker from OMVS or a PUTTY or \nrlogin session. You cannot execute the utility from the ishell. \nIf you use the command line option, remember that the same restrictions described earlier in \nthis document still apply. Also remember that the other SAS Deployment Wizard command \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n76 \nline options may also be used, such as the ‐x11 command line option to use the graphic user \ninterface on z/OS and ‐console on UNIX. \n2. The Specify SAS Software Depot Directory page opens. Enter the location of your SAS \nSoftware Depot in the text box or use the Browse button to search for it. When the correct \nlocation is in the text box, click Next. \n3. The Final Review page opens. Verify the location for the SAS Software Depot is correct, and \nthen click Start. \n4. The SAS Depot Check Utility page opens. As the utility runs, its results are displayed in the \npane on the page. You can temporarily halt the report at any time by clicking Stop. If you \nhalt the utility, it can only be restarted by restarting the utility itself. \n5. When the utility has been halted or has completed its scan, you can review and print the \nutility’s report in one of three ways: \n• \nClick Save Report to open a Save dialog in which you can save a copy of the report. \n• \nClick View in Browser to open the report in the default browser for the machine you \nare running the utility on. \n• \nClick Print Report to open a Print dialog. \nWhen you have completed the tasks you wish to perform with the utility report, click Finish to close \nthe utility. \nView Registry \nFor SAS 9.4, the installation of hot fixes is logged in the SAS Deployment Registry. A reporting utility \nnamed View Registry (sas.tools.viewregistry.jar) processes the deployment registry and \ngenerates a report named DeploymentRegistry.html. The deployment registry report identifies \nall SAS 9.4 software that is installed in the current SASHOME location, including hot fixes. The \nfollowing is a sample of the output: \n____________________ \nHost: s64 \nProduct Code: base \nVersion: 9.4 \nDisplay Name: Base SAS \nDisplay Version: 9.4 \nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A01002 \nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A01012 \nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A01021 \nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A50001 \nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A50005 \nHotfix Entry: Hotfix A50016 \n____________________ \nHost: s64 \nProduct Code: stat \nVersion: 9.4 \nDisplay Name: SAS/STAT \nDisplay Version: 9.4 \n____________________ \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n77 \nA text file version of the report, DeploymentRegistry.txt is also created. Both the HTML and .txt \nfiles are created in the <SASHOME>/deploymntreg directory. The utility is installed by default with \nSAS 9.4 in <SASHOME>/deploymntreg.  \nUse the following steps to generate a deployment registry report using this utility. Note that \nsas.tools.viewregistry.jar must be executed from the <SASHOME>/deploymntreg \ndirectory.  \nWindows: \nLaunch sas.tools.viewregistry.jar (the default location is C:\\Program \nFiles\\SASHome\\deploymntreg). \nUNIX: \nExecute the JAR file. For example: \njava –jar sas.tools.viewregistry.jar  \nNote:  In order to run the reporting utility, Windows users must have Write permissions for the \ndeploymntreg directory (the default location is C:\\Program \nFiles\\SASHome\\deploymntreg) because the resulting reports are written to this location. \nUNIX users must have Write permission to the SASHOME location.  \nCommand line options: \n-hotfix  \nreports only the product components to which hot fixes have been applied, including the hot fix IDs. \nNo parameter is accepted.  \nExample: \njava -jar sas.tools.viewregistry.jar -hotfix  \n \n-out <parameter>  \nspecifies an alternative output directory for DeploymentRegistry.html and \nDeploymentRegistry.txt. This option should be used if you do not have Write access to \nSASHOME, which is the default output location.  \nExample: \njava -jar sas.tools.viewregistry.jar -out /u/myuserid/output  \n \n-all  \n(valid beginning with SAS 9.4 M3) reports all product components that have been installed, which \nmay include multiple releases of a product component that has been upgraded. No parameter is \naccepted.  \nExample: \njava -jar sas.tools.viewregistry.jar -all \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n78 \nSAS Update File Cleanup Utility (Windows and UNIX only) \nAs the SAS Deployment Wizard performs updates to an existing deployment, it creates backup files \nto be used should you need to roll back the updates. However, once you are confident that the \nupdates will not need removal, SAS has provided a tool to remove the backup files and free up space. \nThe following instructions describe how to invoke and use the SAS Update File Cleanup Utility. The \nSAS Update File Cleanup Utility is only available for Windows and UNIX users. \n1. In the course of installing updates, the SAS Update File Cleanup Utility is placed in your \nSASHOME, at <SASHOME>\\InstallMisc\\9.4. Windows users should double-click \ncleanup.exe at that location, and UNIX users should start cleanup.sh. \n2. The SAS Update File Cleanup Utility opens, listing the SASHOME that will be cleaned up. \nThe utility can only be used in the SASHOME where it is located, so if you want to clean up \nSASHOME on different machines, you must use the SAS Update File Cleanup Utility placed \non each machine when an update was performed on it. \n3. Note that any files that are removed by the utility cannot be recovered. If you accept this \ncondition, click Remove Backup Files to start the utility. The Results pane will show where \nthe utility is scanning, what files are being deleted, and how much space is being cleared. \n4. When the utility finishes running, click Close to close the utility. \n \n \nPage 79 \n \nAppendix A — Independent Installation of SAS Products \nOverview \nBeginning with SAS 9.4, some SAS products will be delivered in two formats: the first is the standard \nformat to be installed by the SAS Deployment Wizard, and the second is an independent format that \ndoes not require using the SAS Deployment Wizard. This second format is much smaller, thereby \nmaking it easier to install over a distributed deployment, especially using provisioning tools such as \nMicrosoft’s SCCM. The three products to take advantage of the smaller format are SAS Enterprise \nGuide, SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office, and SAS Visual Analytics Add-In for Microsoft Office (a \nsubset of SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office used to open SAS Visual Analytics reports). These products \nare only available on Windows. \nUsers of SAS Viya can take advantage of the same format for these products to deploy them \nindependently on Windows machines separate from their SAS Viya deployments. \nWARNING for SAS 9.4 users:     \nIf you are working from a software order that is older than SAS 9.4 (TS1M1), Rev. 940_13w51, \nthe independent installation format is intended for a user to easily distribute ONLY SAS \nEnterprise Guide and/or SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office to client machines. If you intend to \ninstall other SAS 9.4 software or already have other SAS 9.4 software installed on the machine, \nthen you MUST use the SAS Deployment Wizard to install these products. Installing the \nindependent installation formats on machines with software older than SAS 9.4 is permitted.  \nBeginning with the SAS 9.4 (TS1M2), Rev. 940_14w41 version of the software, the \nindependent versions of the software can be included in any SAS 9.4 SASHOME. \nTo determine the revision of your software, refer to SAS note 50493, located at \nhttp://support.sas.com/kb/50/493.html \nInstallation \nFor SAS 9.4 customers, the smaller versions of these products are only available with enterprise \nserver environment orders that already included SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Add-in for Microsoft \nOffice, or SAS Visual Analytics Add-In for Office. If you have any of these products in your order, the \ncorresponding executable files are in the standalone_installs directory at the top level of your \nSAS Software Depot with the file names described below. The standalone_installs directory \nwill not be available if the order is for workstation environments. \nNote:  The standalone_installs directory is only available in software depots that have been created \nusing a full order. If you subset your software order in any way, the resulting software depot will not \ncontain the standalone_installs directory. \nFor SAS Viya customers, the standalone_installs directory is available after you perform the \nsteps described in your Software Order Email (SOE). \nThese are the file names for the independent installers: \n• \nSASAddInForMicrosoftOffice<version number>_x86_x64.exe – SAS Add-in for \nMicrosoft Office for the version number used in the file name, (such as “71” for version 7.1) \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n80 \n• \nVisualAnalyticsAddInForOffice<version number>_x86_x64.exe – SAS Add-in \nfor Microsoft Office for Visual Analytics for the version number used in the file name \nNote: Beginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25, the independent install for Visual \nAnalytics Add-in for Office is included with SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office. To install \nVisual Analytics Add-in for Office, you should follow the instructions to deploy SAS Add-in \nfor Microsoft Office. \n• \nSASEnterpriseGuide<version number>_x86_x64.exe – SAS Enterprise Guide for \nthe version number used in the file name \nNote for SAS 9.4 users:   \nIf you expect to find the executable for an independent version of SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office and \ndo not, it is likely that you do not have the full SAS add-in product. For some product combinations, \nSAS provides an add-in that works only with Microsoft Excel. There is no independent install \navailable for the Microsoft Excel-only version of the add-in. If you want the full SAS add-in product, \nincluding the independent version of the SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office, you should contact your \nSAS Site Representative who in turn will need to contact their SAS Sales Representative or the SAS \nContracts department. \nIf you are installing to a system that has a previous version of an independent product already \ninstalled, the executables will update the product to the version used in the name of the file. \nIn addition, all the Microsoft requirements for the installation of the products are included except for \nthe Microsoft .NET Framework, which has been excluded due its size. If you intend to use the \nindependent version of the installers, you should install the version of Microsoft .NET appropriate \nfor the version of the independent installer on your machine. \nVersion of independent \ninstaller \nRequired version of \nMicrosoft .NET \n6.1, 6.1M1, 6.1M2 \n4.0 \n7.1, 7.11, 7.12, 7.13, \n7.14, 7.15, 8.0 \n4.5.1 or later version in \nthe .NET 4.x family \n8.1, 8.2 \n4.7.1 or later version in \nthe .NET 4.x family \n8.3 \n4.8 or later version in \nthe .NET 4.x family \n \nUse the following steps to install your independent package: \nNote:  SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office and SAS Visual Analytics Add-In for Office cannot be installed in \nthe same machine. \n1. In the SAS Software Depot you created following the instructions from your SOE, select the \npackage you wish to install. Double-click the executable file for the package you have \nselected. \nNote:  If you wish to install both SAS Enterprise Guide and one of the other independent products, \nyou must go through this procedure twice, once for each product. \n2. The Ready to Install page opens. Click Install to continue. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n81 \n3. The Initializing and Installing page opens, indicating that files are being moved to a \ntemporary space. When the files have been moved, the Choose Language page opens. Select \nthe language in which you want to install from the list, and then click OK to continue. \n4. The Specify SAS Home page opens. Enter the location where you want to install the \nsoftware in the text box or use Browse to search for a location. Do not select a SASHome \nlocation that contains a SAS Software Depot. When you have entered a location, click Next to \ncontinue. \nNote: \n If you install 32-bit SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office, or SAS Visual \nAnalytics Add-In for Office on a 64-bit Windows OS and select a destination location in \nC:\\Program Files\\, the application will be installed in  \nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\ instead (with no other path changes).  The MSI technology \nused to install these applications enforces the recommended standard of installing 32-bit \napplications in the 32-bit Program Files location, C:\\Program Files (x86)\\. \n5. If you are installing SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office or SAS Visual Analytics Add-In for \nOffice and you do not have Microsoft Office installed on the machine, the Select SAS Add-in \nfor Microsoft Office Mode page opens. Use this page to specify whether you wish to install \nSAS Add-in for Microsoft Office in 32-bit compatibility mode or 64-bit native mode. Your \nselection should be based on the “bitness” of Microsoft Office that you intend to install and \nnot on the operating system. When you have made your selection, click Next to continue.  \n6. The Select Language Support page opens. Specify the languages you want to install with \nyour product. You can use Select All to choose all of the languages or Clear All to remove \nthe selection from all of the languages except English. When you have made your choices, \nclick Next to continue. \n7. If you are installing SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office or SAS Visual Analytics Add-In for \nOffice, the Select Microsoft Office Applications page opens. Select each Microsoft Office \nproduct that that will activate the SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office. When your selection is \ncomplete, click Next to continue. \n8. The Checking System page opens as the installer ensures that the machine has the resources \nnecessary for the package you are working with. After it has finished its check, either click \nNext to continue, or Back to make changes in your selections. \nNote that the independent installer includes all the third-party software you need from \nMicrosoft to install and run your software, except Microsoft .NET Framework. During the \nsystem check, if the installer determines that you either do not have Microsoft .NET \nFramework or have an insufficient version of it, a warning message will open. If you get this \nwarning message, you should exit the installation, download and install the appropriate \nversion of Microsoft .NET Framework, and then restart the installation at step 1 above. \n9. The Deployment Summary page opens, listing what is about to be installed on your \nmachine. Note that there are more products than just SAS Enterprise Guide or SAS Add-in \nfor Microsoft Office because the installation also includes other SAS software required for the \nsuccessful installation and use of your package. Click Start to continue. \n10. A progress page opens, indicating success or failure for each product being installed. When \nthe installation is complete, the Deployment Complete page opens. Click Next to continue. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n82 \n11. The Additional Resources page opens, listing documentation and web sites that might be \nuseful to your deployment. When you are ready, click Finish to close the installer. \n12. The Completed X Installation page opens, where X is the name of the product you just \ninstalled. Click Finish to close the Microsoft installation wrapper. \nWhen the installer closes, it removes all the files that had been placed in temporary space, leaving a \nfootprint only in the location where the software has been installed. \nCommand Line Options \nIndependent Record Usage \nX.exe ‐‐ ‐record ‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\" \nX represents the appropriate independent installer executable file for your package. IMPORTANT: \nThe command line includes two dashes followed by ‐record with a space between them.  \nIndependent Record Example \nSASEnterpriseGuide61_x64.exe ‐‐ ‐record ‐responsefile \n\"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\" \nQuiet Independent Install Usage \nX.exe /verysilent [‐‐ ‐responsefile \"<full path to the response file>\"] \nX represents the appropriate independent installer executable file for your package. IMPORTANT: \nThe command line includes two dashes followed by ‐responsefile with a space between them. \nQuiet Independent Install Example \nSASEnterpriseGuide61_x64.exe /verysilent ‐‐ ‐responsefile \n\"C:\\sdwresponse.properties\" \nUninstallation \nBeginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25, the independent products include a version of the \nSAS Deployment Manager, thereby changing how the software should be uninstalled. This \nuninstallation topic describes the method to remove the independent products for releases before \nSAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and for SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and after. \nNote:  To determine the revision of your software, refer to SAS note 50493, located at \nhttp://support.sas.com/kb/50/493.html \nBefore SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 \nNormal Mode \nTo remove the independent products from a machine, use Uninstall a program in the Windows \nControl Panel. When the list of software to uninstall is created, there will be an entry for each \nindependent product for every language that you originally installed in. For example, if you install \nSAS Enterprise Guide in English and French, you will have to uninstall both the English and French \nversions with the Control Panel. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n83 \nAfter the Control Panel has completed its task, artifacts from the installation will remain in the \ninstallation directory. These are no longer needed and can be safely removed manually. In addition, \nsoftware (such as SAS Integration Technologies Client and SAS Providers for OLE DB) that is \nrequired for the product you’ve uninstalled will remain in your SAS Home. Before manually \nremoving these shared components, ensure that all other SAS software is uninstalled since these \ncomponents may be required for software that remains on the machine. \nQuiet Mode \nThe products described in this section can also be uninstalled in quiet mode by invoking the \nMicrosoft installation wrapper with command line options.  \nUsage \nmsiexec.exe /qn /x {<product GUID>} \nNote that there is a specific product GUID to be used for every combination of product and language. \nUse of the wrong product code will result in the failure of the uninstallation. The command must be \nused for each product and language combination that you want to remove. \nNote also that the curly brackets should be included in the command around the product GUID. In \norder to find the appropriate product GUID, you should look in the registry under the following \nproduct registry keys. \n• \nSAS Enterprise Guide: \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\SAS Institute Inc.\\Enterprise Guide\\6.1 \n• \nSAS Add-In for Microsoft Office (64-bit software on a 64-bit machine) : \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\SAS Institute Inc.\\AddIn for Microsoft Office\\6.1 \n• \nSAS Add-In for Microsoft Office (32-bit software on a 64-bit machine): \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\SAS Institute Inc.\\AddIn for \nMicrosoft Office\\6.1 \n• \nSAS Add-In for Microsoft Office (32-bit software on a 32-bit machine): \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\SAS Institute Inc.\\AddIn for Microsoft Office\\6.1 \nThe languages are installed under the products registry key in a LanguageResources folder which \ncontains an entry for each language code. So for example, if SAS Enterprise Guide is installed with \nItalian and Russian resources, the following keys will exist: \n• \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\SAS Institute Inc.\\Enterprise \nGuide\\6.1\\LanguageResources\\IT \n• \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\SAS Institute Inc.\\Enterprise \nGuide\\6.1\\LanguageResources\\RU \nAll of the above registry keys will have a ProductId value inside them which contains the product \nGUID. The following table lists the language codes and their identifiers. \n \nCode \nLanguage Resource \nAR \nArabic resources \nDA \nDanish resources \nDE \nGerman resources \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n84 \nES \nSpanish resources \nFR \nFrench resources \nHE \nHebrew resources \nHU \nHungarian resources \nIT \nItalian resources \nJA \nJapanese resources \nKO \nKorean resources \nNL \nDutch resources \nPL \nPolish resources \nRU \nRussian resources \nSV \nSwedish resources \nTR \nTurkish resources \nzh-CN \nChinese (simplified) Resources \nzh-HK \nChinese (traditional, Hong Kong) resources \nzh-TW \nChinese (traditional, Taiwan) resources \n \nExample \nmsiexec.exe /qn /x {604F30E1-35F2-4E34-AA21-3E83CDE863E1} \nThis command will uninstall SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1 in English. \nAfter the uninstall is completed, artifacts from the installation will remain in the installation \ndirectory. These are no longer needed and can be safely removed manually. In addition, software \n(such as SAS Integration Technologies Client and SAS Providers for OLE DB) that is required for the \nproduct you’ve uninstalled will remain in your SAS Home. Before manually removing these shared \ncomponents, ensure that all other SAS software is uninstalled since these components may be \nrequired for software that remains on the machine. \nSAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and After (Including SAS Viya) \nBecause the independent products include the SAS Deployment Manager, you should follow the \ninstructions at “Uninstall SAS Software (Graphical User Interface Uninstall Tool)” on page 48 to \nremove them from your deployment. \nApplying Hot Fixes \nBeginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25, the independent products include a version of the \nSAS Deployment Manager, thereby changing how hot fixes should be installed. This hot fix topic \ndescribes the method to apply hot fixes for releases before SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and for \nSAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and after. \nNote:  To determine the revision of your software, refer to SAS note 50493, located at \nhttp://support.sas.com/kb/50/493.html \nSAS Deployment Wizard/ SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n85 \nBefore SAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 \nThe description of this process assumes that you have already downloaded the hot fix zip files for \nyour product from http://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/hotfix/hotfix.html. If you \ndo not have the necessary zip files, go to that link and follow the instructions there to find and \ndownload the appropriate files.  \nThe hot fix zip file is named using the following pattern: \n<hot fix ID number><operating system>.zip \nwhere ID number is a unique identifier using a letter and five digits, and operating system is a \ntwo-byte code for the Windows operating system (wn for 32-bit Windows and x6 for 64-bit \nWindows). For example, S22001x6.zip is the zip file containing S22001 for 64-bit Windows. \n1. Create a directory on your machine that is named using the full identifier. So, \nS22001x6.zip, you would create a directory named S22001x6. You should create a \ndirectory for each hot fix zip file you have downloaded. \n2. Unzip the contents of the zip file into the directory you just created. If you have more than \none zip file, ensure that the contents of each zip file are extracted into the appropriate \ndirectory. \n3. Go to the \\products subdirectory of the new directory. Notice that there are a number of \ndirectories, named something like this: \nmsofficeint__S22001__wx6__en__sp0__1 \nThe name uses the following pattern: \n<product identifier>__<hot fix ID number>__<operating \nsystem>__<language code>__sp0__1 \nThe product identifier is a code to identify the product that is affected by the hot fix, \nusually msofficeint for SAS Add-in for Microsoft Office or eguide for SAS Enterprise \nGuide. Some hot fixes are for both products and will only have one of the two product codes.  \nThe hot fix ID number is the same that was used on the zip file. \nThe operating system is a three-byte code with win representing 32-bit Windows and \nwx6 representing 64-bit Windows. \nFinally, the language code corresponds to the language the hot fix is for, according to the \nfollowing list: \nCode \nLanguage  \nde \nGerman  \nen \nEnglish \nes \nSpanish  \nfr \nFrench  \nit \nItalian  \nja \nJapanese  \nko \nKorean  \npl \nPolish  \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n86 \nru \nRussian  \nzh \nChinese (simplified)  \nzX \nChinese (traditional, Hong Kong)  \nzt \nChinese (traditional, Taiwan)  \nMake note of the name of the directories for the languages for which you want to apply the \nhot fix. \n4. If you want to perform a standard installation (rather than a quiet installation), go to the \ndirectory which is named after the right appropriate combination of product, operating \nsystem, and language. In that directory, double-click on the .msp file to perform the \ninstallation. The following in an example path to the .msp file. \nC:\\S22001x6\\products\\msofficeint__S22001__wx6__en__sp0__1\\ \nmsofficeint_patch.msp \nIf you want to perform a quiet installation, open a command prompt and issue the following \ncommand in this format: \nmsiexec.exe /update \"<path to executable file>\\<product \nidentifier>.msp\" /qn /norestart \nThe path to executable file is the full path to the language-specific directory you \nfound in step 3. The product identifier is the same that is described in step 3. The \nfollowing is an example of such a command, assuming that we created the S22001x6 \ndirectory on the C: drive and we want to install the English hot fix: \nmsiexec.exe /update \"C:\\S22001x6\\products\\ \nmsofficeint__S22001__wx6__en__sp0__1\\msofficeint_patch.msp\" /qn \n/norestart \n5. Repeat step 4 for each language that you have used to install the original product. \nSAS 9.4 (TS1M6), Rev. 940_19w25 and After (Including SAS Viya) \nBecause the independent products include the SAS Deployment Manager, you should follow the \ninstructions at “Applying Hot Fixes after the Installation” on page 30 to apply hot fixes to them and \ntheir associated products. \n \n \n \nPage 87 \n \nAppendix B — Windows Administration \nPreparing for a SAS Installation in a Terminal Server Environment or Citrix \nTo properly install SAS 9.4 on a server with Terminal Services, the following steps must be \nperformed: \n1. Log on as an administrator to the Terminal Server to which SAS 9.4 will be installed. \n2. Install mode is required for installing applications on Windows Terminal Servers. There are \ntwo ways to place the system in install mode: \n• \nUse the Add/Remove Programs Control Panel icon and select Install. You will be asked \nto change the user option. Be sure to select the option that allows all users to begin with \ncommon application settings. \n• \nType change user /install at a command prompt (cmd.exe). A message will \ninform you if the install mode is set correctly. \n3. Installation of SAS 9.4 on Terminal Servers may require system reboots. In order to minimize \nuser interruption, have all users log off of the terminal server before installation. A remote \nterminal session can be used to install SAS software to a Terminal Server, but it is not a \nrecommended practice due to the potential for reboots. \nBefore you proceed with this installation, SAS recommends that you close your anti-virus and \nfirewall software. If you keep those types of software running, you increase the possibility that one or \nmore reinstallations of SAS software will be necessary, since certain anti-virus and/or firewall \nconfigurations can prevent an application from installing successfully. If you are unable to close the \nanti-virus or firewall software, make sure that the configuration allows you to install software and to \nupdate the registry. If your SAS installation fails and you have mandatory anti-virus or firewall \nsoftware running, please check with your system administrator. \nIf a reboot is required, you will have to reestablish the connection to the Terminal Server after the \nreboot is complete and you may need to put the server back in install mode. After logging on to the \nTerminal Server session, the set-up should restart and continue the installation. If the set-up does not \nrestart, start the set-up and it will resume where it left off before the reboot.  \nInstalling SAS 9.4 in a Terminal Server Environment or Citrix \nInstalling SAS 9.4 on a server with Terminal Services is the same as installing SAS 9.4 on any server.  \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n88 \n \n \n \nPage 89 \n \nAppendix C — UNIX Administration \n \nThe following are sample mount commands for each supported UNIX system. The device names \nlisted below are used only for example; substitute your actual device names accordingly. These \ninstructions assume your mount point is /mnt/dvdrom; however, you may choose another location. \nNote:  Because of the number of variances based on the deployment of your hardware, these commands are \nnecessarily generic. For the exact mount command you should use, contact your system administrator. \nAIX \n# mount -r -v cdrfs /dev/cd0 /mnt/dvdrom \n \nHP-UX for the Itanium Processor Family \n# mount -F cdfs -o rr,ro /dev/dsk/c0t0d0 /mnt/dvdrom \n \nLinux for x64 \n# mount -r /dev/dvd /mnt/dvdrom \n \nSolaris and Solaris for x64 \n# mount -r -F hsfs /dev/dvd /mnt/dvdrom \n \nRemote Mounting \nIf your DVD drive resides on another host, and is properly exported, mount the DVD using NFS by \nissuing a command similar to the following: \n# mount -o ro <remotehost>:/<dvd-rom-dir> /mnt/dvdrom \nIn this example, <remotehost> refers to the machine that owns the DVD drive and  \n<dvd-rom-dir> is the actual mount point for the DVD drive on the server.  \nOnce the DVD is mounted, launch the executable with the following command: \n$ /mnt/dvdrom/<executable> \n \n Note: When using a system with an automounter, it is common for a File Manager window to display when \nthe media is inserted in the DVD drive. Do not invoke the executable via the File Manager since this \nwill create a “Device busy” condition, preventing disk swapping later in the install process. \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n90 \n \n \n \nPage 91 \n \nAppendix D — SAS Depot Checker (Old Style) \nPrior to SAS 9.4, the SAS Software Depot Check Utility did not run on z/OS machines. However, \nbeginning with SAS 9.4 (TS1M2), Rev. 940_14w41, the utility will work on all supported operating \nsystems for SAS 9.4. If you are using a deployment from before SAS 9.4 (TS1M2), Rev. 940_14w41, \nyou will still have the previous version of the utility, described in this appendix. For information \nabout the new version of the utility, refer to the “SAS Software Depot Check Utility” section of \nChapter 9. \nOverview \nThe SAS Software Depot Check Utility verifies the existence of expected files in SAS 9.4 software \ndepots. The SAS Software Depot Check Utility performs the following tasks in order to provide you \nwith information about the files in your depot: \n• \ntotals the files found in a depot  \n• \nlists files found and their directory path(s)  \n• \nlists and totals the files missing from the depot and shows the paths where the missing files \nshould be found \n• \nlists and totals the orders found \n• \nlists and totals the SAS installation data files found \n• \nlists the files that are the wrong size and specifies their incorrect and correct sizes \n• \nlists the files where checksums are incorrect and specifies their correct and incorrect \nchecksums \nThe SAS Software Depot Check Utility can be used to validate SAS 9.4 depots, including depots that \ncontain subsetted orders that have been created during initial download with the SAS Download \nManager, and depots that contain subsetted orders that have been created using the SAS Deployment \nWizard. \nThe following is an example of the output of the SAS Software Depot Check Utility: \nSAS Software Depot Check Utility version X.X \nThu 12/15/11 8:37:24 AM \nUSERNAME=someuser \n   \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software Depot\\sid_files \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software Depot\\cd.id \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software Depot\\sassd.txt \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software Depot\\setup.dat \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software Depot\\depotsummary.html \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software Depot\\order_data \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software Depot\\cd.id \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software \nDepot\\products\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\deployment.xml \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software \nDepot\\products\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\en_bin.xml \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software \nDepot\\products\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\en_bin.zip \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software \nDepot\\products\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\en_lib.xml \nSAS Deployment Wizard/SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide \n92 \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software \nDepot\\products\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\en_lib.zip \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software \nDepot\\products\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\en_misc.xml \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software \nDepot\\products\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\en_misc.zip \nFOUND: C:\\SAS Software \nDepot\\products\\acceldb2fmt__93130__dba__en__sp0__1\\install.xml \n… \n*** 13408 Files were checked in C:\\SAS Software Depot \n    \n*** 2 Orders were found in this depot:  \n099GN1 \n09B4RX \n    \n*** 2 SID files were found in C:\\SAS Software Depot\\sid_files:  \nSAS93_099GN1_70068130_Win_X64_Wrkstn_Srv.txt \nSAS93_09B4RX_70068128_Win_X64_Wrkstn.txt \n    \n*** No files with wrong size were found in this depot.  \n    \n*** No files with wrong checksums were found in this depot. \nRunning the SAS Software Depot Check Utility with a User Interface on \nWindows \nPerform the following steps to run the SAS Software Depot Check Utility with a user interface on a \nWindows machine. SAS strongly recommends that the user ID that was used to download the SAS \nSoftware Depot also be used to execute the SAS Software Depot Check Utility. \n1.

{"text": "[转载]请回答,你看完没有?\n原文地址:请回答,你看完没有？作者:美女赢家 一、炒股与人性 俗话说,挣钱只有三个方法:用手,用脑,用钱。用手挣钱挣的是辛苦钱,用脑挣钱的已算是人上人,真正的挣钱是用钱挣钱。用钱挣钱,听来多么吸引人,谁不想用钱挣钱？但用钱挣钱的先决条件是必须有钱,其次是你有相关知识来用这些钱挣钱。股市就提供了这种完美的机会。炒股是有技术的。炒股的技术来自于经验的积累,这一积累过程是艰难且痛苦的,那些懒惰的人,不愿动脑的人和只想快快发财的人在这行没有生存的空间。和其它行业不同的是,这行的技术不是死的,它是一种\"心态\",看不见摸不着的\"心态\"。你只能有心来感悟它。你学习修车,轮胎坏了换轮胎,刹车坏了换刹车,只要熬的时间够长,你就会成为修车专家。换轮胎、换刹车都是看得见摸得着的东西,上次是这么换,下次还一样。股票可不同了,上次出这个新闻时股票升,下次出同样的新闻股票可能跌。你怎么知道股票会升会跌？靠的就是感觉。你必须有何时股票运动正常,何时股票运动不正常的感觉。(博士注:有的人一学便会,有的人学十年还是不会) 二、人性与经验 让我举个例子来解释\"心态\"是什么东西。大家听过、看过、读过很多骗人或被骗的故事。往往是骗人的花招并不高明,被骗的人也并不蠢,但大同小异的故事总是不断发生。我曾细细探讨过其原因,结果发现上当受骗者往往有一共同的特点:\"贪\"！想不劳而获。这个\"贪\"就是心态。你可以教他很多招式,如下次碰到什么情形不要相信等等。但只要他不改\"贪\"的心态,他一定还会上当受骗,骗子的花招总比他的防招来得多。你要教他\"不贪\"才能真防上当受骗,你几时看到过\"不贪\"的人被骗的？\"不贪\"也是心态。 \"贪\"是人性,\"不贪\"是经验。你不可能叫一个人不贪他就不贪了。他要吃很多亏、上很多当才明白\"不贪\"是不再吃亏上当的灵丹妙药。[这是精华总结！] 炒股也一样。下面,你很快就会明白炒股的最重要的原则就是止损。但人性是好贪小偏宜,不肯吃小亏,只有不断地因为贪了小便宜却失去大偏宜,不肯吃小亏最终却吃了大亏,你才能最终学会不贪小便宜,不怕吃小亏。可以这么说,学股的过程就是克服\"贪\"等与生俱来的人性,养成\"不贪\"等后天的经验的过程。这个学习的过程并不如同一般人想像的那么简单。好贪小便宜,不肯吃小亏是心态。不贪小便宜,不怕吃小亏也是心态。要实现这种心态的转变,你要战胜自己。战胜自己可不是件容易的事,这也是聪明人常常学不会炒股的原因。他们能够战胜自然,但他们往往无法战胜自己。[\"战胜自己\"是经常耳闻目濡的词,但是能理会其中真正含义的人少之有少,很多人只把它理解为是一句空洞的口号。如我博士宁愿花大量时间为菜鸟写点入门基识,不贪任何回报,其实在这过程中也加深了我自己,让我在更高的角度认识问题。] 人有很多缺点,这些缺点的形成有的可以说是动物的本能,有些是长期生活中培养出来的习惯。股市有它自己的特点。在股市中,人的缺点无所遁形。下面让我们探计一下股市的特点及普通人难以在股市成功的原因。 三、特殊的赌局:股票充满诱惑性 股票的诞生依赖于其所代表的企业的资产。但股票一旦出生,脱离了母体,它就有了自己的生命,不再完全领带母体了。一头母猪现价100元,把它分成100份股票出卖,每股应是一元。这一小学生都不会算错的题目在股市上就会走样了。假设将这头母猪注册成凤凰大集团,发行100股凤凰大集团的股票,你认为凤凰大集团的股票每股值多少？如果将这些股票上市,你认为凤凰大集团的股票会以什么价钱交易？答案是它既可能以每股一毛钱的价格交易,因为股民会认为母猪会老,会死！但也可能以每股上百元的价位交易,因为他们也会想像到母猪每半年能生10只小猪,而小猪长大后又会生小猪,真是财源滚滚,永无止境！只要养这头母猪的张嫂,也就是凤凰大集团的张董事长,能说服股民们相信这头母猪的生育能力奇强,而她经营管理能力又是特高！凤凰大集团的股票被炒到上千元也不奇怪。毫无疑问,凤凰大集团的公司介绍上不会说只是一头母猪,它会告诉股民们集团从事的是\"饲料购销、良种培育\"之类挑战性的业务。到底股价和股票所代表的价值有什么关系？有一个流传的故事:两位炒手交易一罐沙丁鱼罐头,每次交易,一方都以更高的价钱从对方手中买进这罐沙丁鱼,不断交易下来,双方都赚了不少钱。有一天,其中一位决定打开罐头看看,了解一下为什么一罐沙丁鱼要卖这么高的价钱？结果他发现这罐沙丁鱼是臭的。他以此指责对方卖假货。对方回答说:\"谁要你打开的？这罐沙丁鱼是用来交易的,不是用来吃的！\"股票的迷惑性不在于股票所基于的价值,而在于它给炒股者提供的幻想。[这是真正理解了什么是股票的人,这也就是我们常说的:\"股市中万物都是虚幻\"] 到赌场去赌钱,你知道何时赌局开始,因为庄家会告诉你该下注了。你也知道赌局何时结束,全部的牌一翻开,这个赌局就结束了。你很清楚输会输多少,你也知道赢会赢多少。在股市下注,你直接面对何时进场、何时等待、何时出场的决定。没有人告诉你进场的时间,每个决定都是那么的艰难,每个决定都没有定规。你不知这一注下去赢会赢多��？输会输多少？赌注的数额也必须由你决定。所有这些决定都是令人生畏的。你决定进场了,幸运地你有了利润,股价升了。你马上面对一个问题:够吗？你怎么知道股价的波动不会一波高过一波？不幸地股价跌破你的买价,你也面对一个问题:亏多少？更要命的是你不知道它是不是暂时下跌,很快就会反弹？如果最终有可能得到胜利,为什么现在要承认失败？在股市这恒久的赌局中,你每时每刻都面对着这些决定。更重要的是,在股市上的这些选择,并不仅仅是脑子一转,而是必须采取一定的行动才能控制你所投资金的命运。不采取行动,你的赌注永远都在台面上。而\"行动\"二字对懒惰的人来说是多么令人厌憎的字眼！问问你自己喜欢做决定吗？喜欢独自为自己的决定负全部责任吗？对99%的人来说,答案都是否定的。股市这一恒久的赌局却要求你每时每刻都要做理性的决定且为决定的结果负全部的责任！这就淘汰了一大部分股民,因为他们没有办法长期承担这样的心理压力。(呵,能看到这里,还在仔细看的人不知多不多？应该至小有10%不看了,他会说,又长又臭,还是博士你直接告诉我买什么股票好的多。) 四、一般的股民何以失败 从技术的角度探讨一般股民失败的原因,自然可以归纳出好多条,这里仅从人性的角度,用心理分析的方法,来看看一般股民在股市当中何以宿命般地会遭遇失败的命运。 1、人性讨厌风险有位心理医生,他请了一批人来做两个实验。实验一选择:第一,75%的机会得到1000美元,但有25%的机会什么都得不到；第二,确定得到700美元。虽然一再向参加实验者解释,从概率上来说,第一选择能得到1000美元的机会有75%,可结果还是有80%的人选择了第二选择。大多数人宁愿少些,也要确定的利润。实验二选择:第一,75%的机会付出1000美元,但有25%的机会什么都不付；第二,确定付出700美元。结果是75%的选择了第一选择。他们为了搏25%什么都不付的机会,从数字上讲多失去了300美元。问问你自己,如果你是参加实验的一员,你会做什么样的选择？股票是概率的游戏,无论什么样的买卖决定,都没有100%正确或不正确的划分。人性中讨厌风险的天性便在其中扮演角色。我们看到股民好获小利,买进的股票升了一点,便迫不及待地脱手。这只股票或许有75%继续上升的机会,但为了避免25%什么都得不到的可能性,股民宁可少赚些。结果是可能有5000元利润的机会,你只得到500元。任何炒过股的读者都明白,要用比出场价更高的价位重新入场是多么困难。股价一天比一天高,你只能做旁观者。而一旦买进的股票跌了,股民便死皮赖脸不肯止损,想像出各种各样的理由说服自己下跌只是暂时的。其真正的原因只不过为了搏那25%可能全身而退的机会！结果是小亏慢慢积累成大亏。每次我看到 \"套牢\"、\"割肉\"等词汇,都要拍案叫绝。发明这些名词的人真应得诺贝尔文学奖！这些词语对那些不肯止损的股民的描绘实在太形象了！假如说股票的运动只有上、下两种途径,所以每次买股的赢亏机会原来各是均等的50%的话,对于一般股民来说,由于人性好小便宜、吃不得小亏的心理,使得在股市中赢时赚小钱,亏时亏大钱,它就成了输赢机会不是均等的游戏。股市没有击败你,你自己击败了自己。 2、人的发财心太急我读过很多炒家的传记,在他们成为\"家\"之前,往往都有破产的记录。比如本世纪初的炒家杰西.利物莫,他便有三次的破产记录。导致他们破产的心理因素通常只有一个:太急着发财！行动上就是注下的太大。假设你今天手头多了1万元,你会觉得松动了一些,也许多上馆子吃两顿,但你仍将住现在的房子,坐同样的公交车,因为它不够改变你的生活方式。现假设你手头多了100万,你可能会买更大的房子,买辆车子及其它你以往想要却因为钱不够而没买的东西。这就是量变到质变的过程。心一旦大了,行动上就开始缺少谨慎。首先是每次买股太多,其次止损止得太迟。为此将遭受巨大损失。如果在赌场,每次下注你都很清楚输赢是多少？运气不好,你下的注全没了,运气好,你也知道赢多少,你没有任何幻想。但在股票市场,你无法预测股票会在某个方向走多远。股票可能翻一倍,也可能翻十倍。由于这种\"赚大钱\"的可能,你失去了心理防备。带着\"赚大钱\"的心理入场,你的注会下得很大。如果不幸开始亏损,要接受\"亏很多钱\"的现实是很困难的。随着亏损的一天天增加,你的正常判断力就慢慢消失了。直到有一天你终于无法承受过于巨大的损失,断腕割肉。你经受了在正常情况下不会发生的大损失。这种赚大钱的可能以及挣了大钱后对你的生活方式、虚荣心及权力的幻想,是极其危险的。可能性是存在的,在现实并不容易实现,你需要有很多的经验,很强的自制能力。[当你可以很有效的自制的时候就说明你已经战胜了自己] 3、人好自以为是大家都知道股价总是在升升落落。当一天结束的时候,股票以某一价钱收盘。你有没有思考过它代表了什么？它代表了股市的参与者在今天收市时对该股票的认同。任何一个交易,都有买方和卖方。你买的股票都是某人卖给你的。交易所提供了一个交易的场合。只要两位股票参与者在特定的价格上,一位愿买,一位愿卖,他们的交易就完成了。价格也就这样确定了。无论按你的想像,他们是多么无知,多么愚蠢,他们在某个价位交易是事实,你不能和事实争辨。你或许认为股票不值这个钱,但事实是有人以这个价钱买了股票。除非你有足够的资金,压倒股市中所有和你意见不合的人,(这便是庄家,是主力),你可以按自己的意志确定股票的交易价格。否则,你的想像,你的判断,你的分析,都不能移动股价一分一毫。要特别指出:在炒股这行,传统的对错在这里是不存在的或者说是没有意义的。无论你的智商多高,有什么学位,多么的德高望重,在股票行你的意见不具备在其他领域的分量。投资大众及他们对未来的看法是影响股价的惟一力量。他们用交易证明自己的信念。你的看法可能影响一部分投资人,但在他们用自己的现金来认同你的看法之前,你所说的一切一钱不值。(呵呵,我博士清楚的很,你认为我说的对,会夸我。我会高兴的。你认为不对,骂我。我也不会生气,本来只是说说而已),对股市的观察者而言,每个交易及其对股价的影响提供了未来走势的信息。你如果能从这些信息中找到其意义,它提供了低买高卖的机会。每位单独的投资人都有他独自买或卖的理由,无论这个理由在你看来是多么荒谬。如果大多数投资者持类似理由,结果是股票随大流而动。你可能对了,但你将亏钱。(这便是我前二个贴反复提到的:趋势是不能逆的！人在潮流中是没有自我的。-见日记贴)股价就是股价,无论你认为这只股票值多少钱,无论你认为股价和股值是如果脱节,股价永远是对的。作为股市的一员,你首先必须是观察者,通过观察来感受股价的走向,通过观察来寻找机会。然后成为参与者,投入资金来实现这个机会。你常常面对两个选择,即选择正确或选择赚钱,在股市,它们常常并不同步。不要太固执己见,不要对自己的分析抱太大信心。认真观察股市,不对时就认错。否则,你在这行生存的机会是不大的！ 4、人好跟风作为单独的投资者,你要决定入场的时间,决定持股的时间,决定出场的时间。而股市就像海洋,它永不停息,没有始点,没有终点,每个浪潮的方向都难以捉摸。虽然它有涨潮,有退潮,但涨潮时有后退的波浪,退潮时有前进的波浪。一句话,股市没有即定的运行准则。要想达到盈利的目的,你必须建立自己的规则。否则,太多的可能会使你无所适从,其结果将是灾难性的。在心理上困难的地方在于:你必须自己建立规则,并完全由自己为这些规则所产生的后果负责,这是极大的责任。承担责任总是让人所畏惧。看看你身边发生的事件就不难明白。一旦有任何差错,张三怪李四,李四推王五。而在股市出错又是如此的容易。对那些还不完全明了股票的运动规律,未能明白在何种情况下应如何应对的新股民来说,建立自己的规则决非易事。因为它必须建立在��识、经验、自我判断等因素之上,况且没有人能立即建立完美的规则,特别在你对该游戏的特性和对风险的承受力还未有合理评价的时候,你必须不断修改这些规则,承担执行这些规则的后果。但新股民既然要投入股市,要成为股市大军的一员,而他们通常不具备制定规则的能力,也没有承担后果的心理准备,那他们自然的选择就只能是\"跟随领袖\"。这些\"领袖\"可能是隔壁的剃头师傅,也可能是楼上的裁缝,理由多半是他们\"炒过几年股票\",\"曾赚过钱\"。这样这些新手们就轻易越过了做决定的横杠,如果结果是失败的,他们也有了代罪羊:\"楼上的王裁缝真是差劲！\"这就是所谓的\"人好跟风\"及其经常性的后果。有一天,一位朋友打电话给我说他准备卖掉手中的所有的股票,我问他为什么？\"昨晚走路摔了一跤,从来都没这么倒霉！\"它们之间有什么联系吗？但我还是说想卖就卖吧,反正不卖你也睡不着。我明白你为什么这么想。一位缺少计划的投资者,他的输赢是随机的。就如同抛硬币一样,无论你怎样想,不知道下一手是出正面还是反面。在股市上,上回赚了钱,他不知道为什么,他不知下回怎么做才能重复赚钱的愉快经历。亏了钱,他也不明白为什么亏,下次该怎么做去防止再次发生亏损的情形。这在心理上必然会产生极其沉重的压力,带来的忧虑、期待和恐惧是难以用笔墨形容的。他觉得自己失去了控制,在股市的海洋中无目的地漂流,不知下一站是何处。你有过这样的经历吗？ 5、人好报复在赌场,我常看到赌徒们输了一手,下一手下注就加倍,再输了,再加倍。希望总有一手能赢,那是就连本带利全回来。这一方面是人性中亏不起的心态,另一方面是报复赌场,报复赌场让他们亏钱。从数学上讲,这是可行的,只有你有足够的资金,总有赢一手的机会。所以美国的赌场都是下注最低额和最高额的规定,够你最多翻七倍。如最低下注额是5美元,最高常是500美元。第一注5美元,二注10美元,三注20美元,四注40美元,只要赢一手,就能翻本。我自己就这么赌过,输得灰头灰脸。你也许不相信连输七手是多么的容易。任何人用这样的翻倍法赌钱,只是加快剃光头回家的时间。在股市中,买进的股票跌了,你就再多买一点,因为第二次买的价钱较上次为低,所以平均进价摊低了。从心理上,你的心态和赌场亏钱时一样。一方面你亏不起,另一方面你在报复股市,报复股市让你亏钱。同时内心希望,只要赢一手,就是连本带利全回来。因为平均进价摊低了,股票的小反弹就能提供你全身而退的机会。这样的心态是极其有害的。股票跌的时候通常有它跌的理由,常常下跌的股票会越跌越低。这样被套牢,你就���陷越深,直到你心理无法承受的地步。一个致命的大亏损,常常就彻底淘汰了一位股民。以上我们讨论了一些股市的特点及人性的弱点。对那些带着只想在股市赚几个零花钱的股友来说,股市在开始时或许很慷慨,随着时间的推移,你就会明白它向你讨债时是何等凶恶。你在和一位巨人搏斗,蛮干是不成的。你要学习技巧,永不和它正面冲突。你要了解这位巨人,熟悉它的习性,在适当的时机,攻击它的要害。只有这样你才有胜利的机会。股市这位巨人很笨重,作为独立炒手的你很灵巧,一旦发现你的攻击无效,你就必须逃开,防备巨人的报复。 五、炒股成功的基本要诀 1、保本炒股是用钱赚钱的行业 一旦你的本金没有了,你就失业了。无论你明天见到多么好的机会,手头没有本金,你只能干着急。几乎所有的行家,他们的炒股的建议便是尽量保住你的本金。而做到保本的办法只有两个:一,快速止损；二,别一次下注太多。炒过股票的朋友都有这样的经历:亏小钱时割点肉容易,亏大钱时割肉就十分困难。这是人性的自然反应。在一项投资上亏太多钱的话,对你的自信心会有极大的打击。你如果有一定的炒股经历,必然同时拥有赚钱和亏钱的经验。赚钱时你有什么感觉？通常你会在内心指责自己为什么开始的时候不多买一些,下次碰到\"应该会赚大钱\"的机会,你自然就会下大注。这是极期危险的。在炒股这一行,没有什么是百分之百的。如果第一手进货太多,一旦股票下跌,噩梦就开始了。每天下跌,你希望这是最后一天；有时小小的反弹,你就把它看成大起的前兆；很快这只股票可能跌得更低,你的心又往下沉。你失去理性判断的能力。人性共通,我算是这些经历的过来人,其痛深切。具体的做法就是分层下注。你如果预备买1000股某只股票,第一手别买1000股,先买200股试试,看看股票的运动是否符合你的预想,然后再决定下一步怎么做。如果不对,尽速止损。[看清楚,不是继续买入完成当初要买入1000股的计划,而是放弃] 如果一切正常,再进400股,结果又理想的话,买足1000股。(博士告诉你:赚了便好,千万不要指责自己为啥不一开始便投入大钱,这样不赚大了吗？这种思想要不得。)由于股票的运动没有定规,你不入场就不可能赚钱,而入场就有可能亏钱,所以承担多少风险便成为每位炒手头痛的事。解决这个问题并无任何捷径,只有靠你自己在实践中摸索你对风险的承受力,不要超出这个界限。然而什么是你对风险的承受力呢？最简单的方法就是问自己睡的好吗？如果你对某只股票担忧到睡不着,表示你承担了太大的风险。卖掉一部分股票,直到你觉得自己睡得好为止。���\"保本\"这个概念牢牢地记在心里,你在炒股时每次犯错,你的体会就会深一层,时间一久,你就知道该怎样做了。 2、要甘于做孤独者 几乎所有成功的投资者都是孤独者,他们必须是孤独者！因为他们常要做和大众不同的事。无论是低买高卖还是高买更高卖,他们都必须维持独立的思维,为了与众不同所以作和大众相反的事是极其危险的[所以我们的现代综合技术九大方法中有一项是\"综合反向思维\",为什么不就是简单的反向思维而用了\"综合\"？反向思维是一种融合技术分析的心理战,不是简单的反向判断就行了。你如果随大流,则你将常常在高点入市,低点出市,你将成为失败者。(建议再看看我的贴,\"在别人恐惧时,是我贪婪的时候了\") 3、必须具有耐心和自制力 耐心和自制力都是听起来很简单但做起来很困难的事情。炒股是极期枯燥无味的工作。读者会嘲笑我的说法,说:\"我炒过股,我觉得极其刺激好玩。\"这是因为你把炒股当成消遣,没有将它当成严肃的工作。我是围棋爱好者,我觉得围棋很好玩。但问问那些下棋为生的人,他们一定会告诉你成日打谱是多么的枯燥单调。其中的道理是一样的。每天收集资料,判断行情,将其和自己的经验参照定好炒股计划,偶尔做做或许是兴奋有趣的事,但经年累月地重复同样的工作就是\"苦工\"。你不把\"苦工\"当成习惯,你在这行成功的机会就不大。(好多人知我博士在晚上1点还上网,你几点睡觉？)因为炒股是如此的单调乏味,新手们就喜欢不顾外在条件地在股市跳进跳出寻刺激。在算帐的时候,你自然明白寻找这一刺激的代价是多么高昂。你必须培养自己的耐心和自制力,否则想在这行成功是很难的。看过狮子是怎样捕猎的吗？它耐心地等待猎物,只有在时机及取胜机会都适合的时候,它才从草丛中跳出来。成功的炒手具有同样的特点,他决不为炒股而炒股,他等合适的时机,然后采取行动。 4、选择卖点让我提醒股友:不要试图寻找股票的最高点,你永远不知股票会升多高。 就我个人的体会,做何时卖股票的决定较决定何时买股票更为困难,亏的时候你希望打平,赚时想赚更多,思想斗争不断进行。对刚学炒股的新手来讲,常有\"不赚不卖\"的心态,这是极其要不得的,带有这样的心态,失败的命运差不多就注定了。这就是为何我在前面\"何时买股票\"一节中特别强调选买点的最最重要点是选择止损点。要决定何时卖股票,最简单的方法就是问自己:我愿此时买进这只股票吗？如果答案是否定的,你就可以考虑卖掉这只股票。在实际操作中,问题其实并没有这么简单,因为无论进场还是出场,都是有代价的。手续费是不应忽略的数目,频繁进入场的结果就是把利润都捐献给政府和证券商了。和买股票一样,卖股票的点也是\"临界点\"。你如果能够做到仅在临界买点入场,临界卖点出场,入场时牢记止损,并注意分摊风险,你的成功的概率就能提至最高,你也就真正成为炒股专家了。 以下让我小结一下何时及怎样卖股票: (1)、注意危险信号随着经验的增加,你会慢慢地产生\"这是该卖的时候了\"的感觉。不要忽略这样的直觉,这是经验。要获得这样的经验,你通常已付出很多学费。相信自己。(看看博士的贴:日记,吧,这是一种感觉,动物在生命面临威协时,会不自觉地、本能地有反映。你们也要相信自己的直觉)。 (2)、保本第一任何情况下,股价超出你的入货点,你应考虑在你的进价之上定个止损点。赚钱的先决条件便是不亏钱。10元进的股票升到12元,应把卖点定在10元之上,如11元。 (3)、亏小钱把止损点定在10%或更小,在任何情况下都不要超出20%。只要条件允许,越小越好！条件允许可以这样理解:5元的股票,10%只有0.5元,50元的股票,10%有5元。对5元的股票,你可以给0.75的浮动空间,把止损点定在4.25元。对50元的股票,你可以给3元的空间,把止损点定在47元。我自己喜欢把止损点定在入市当天的最低点。比如我今天以10.75元买进股票,今天的最高价是11元,最低价是10元,我便以10元作为止损点。以我的经验,如果我的入场点选的正确,股票开始上升,它不应跌回我当天入场的最低点。 (4)、遇有暴利,拿了再说股价在两星期内从18元升到40元。在这样的情况,第一天转头(转头表示收市低于开市)你就可以把股票卖掉。别期待好事情会没完没了。这样的暴升常是股价短期到顶的信号,特别是最后两天,交易最猛增,公司并没有特别的好消息。这是危险信号,它在说:我在吸引最后的傻瓜入场,当最后的傻瓜上钩之后,我就要回头了。这种短期狂升但没有惊人好消息的股票跌起来一样快。这是主力大户吸引傻瓜的常用手法。(如最近的封闭基金连续涨停)。 六、华尔街的家训几百年来,炒股行的先辈们用他们的经验写下一条条的家训。 想在这行生存和成功所必须遵循的原则。这些原则一百年前适用,今天适用,一百年后一样适用,因为人性不会改变。 时刻牢记:市场从来不会错,而你的想法常常是错的！炒股是老行业。在华尔街,一百年前流行的是火车股、钢铁股,接着流行收音机股、电视机股,今天流行的是电脑股、网络股。每种股票的兴起都代表了新的行业和人类文明的进步。在这千变万化的股市历史万象中,惟一不变的是股票的运动规律。和百年前甚至更早时期的先辈一样,现代人有着同样的贪婪、恐惧和希望,一样在亏损时不肯割肉,一样满足于小利而在股票的牛市中途退席。当年的股市充满小道消息,今天的股市还是充满小道消息；当年有公司做假账,今天也有公司做假帐。华尔街一代新人换旧人,每人都希望他的存在能在历史上留下一笔,各种各样的格言警句如恒河沙数。令我惊奇的是,华尔街在近半个世纪已没有出现新的\"家训\"。有人出了些新的规则,仔细读之,只不过用新文字把老的家训重述而已,换汤不换药。 家训: 1、止损,止损,止损！ 我不知道该怎样强调这两字的重要,我也不知还能怎么解释这两个字,这是炒股行的最高行为准则。你如果觉得自己实在没法以比进价更低的价钱卖出手中的股票,那就赶快退出这行吧！你在这行没有任何生存的机会。最后割一次肉,痛一次,你还能剩几块钱替儿子买奶粉。[我们同样说了无数遍的话,2001年下半年的行情让广大投资者知道了止损的重要,530开始的暴跌我不明白为啥好多人让自己的股票跌去5个跌停板,当然,哪些卖不出去的股票是没办法的。] 家训:2、避免买太多股票。 问问自己能记住几个电话号码？普通人是110个,你呢？手头股票太多时,产生的结果就是注意力分散,失去对单独股票的感觉。我一直强调,你必须随时具备股票运动是否正常的感觉,在此基础上才有可能控制进出场的时机。买一大堆类别不同的股票,恨不得挂牌的股票每只都买一些,是新手的典型错误,因为注意力将因此分散。将注意力集中在三至五只最有潜力的股票,随着经验的增加,逐渐将留意的股票增加到十至十五只。我自己的极限是二十只股票。读者可以试试自己的极限何在？但在任何情况下,都不要超出自己的极限。 家训:3、有疑问的时候,离场！ 这是条很容易明白但很不容易做到的规则。很多时候,你根本就对股票的走势失去感觉,你不知它要往上爬还是朝下跌,你也搞不清它处在升势还是跌势。此时,你的最佳选择就是离场！离场不是说不炒股了,而是别碰这只股票。如果手头有这只股票,卖掉！手头没有,别买！我们已经明了久赌能赢的技巧在于每次下注,你的获胜概率必须超过50%,只要你手头还拥有没有感觉的股票,表示你还未将赌注从赌台撤回来。当你不知这只股票走势的时候,你的赢面只剩下50%。专业赌徒决不会在这时把赌注留在台面上。别让\"专业赌徒\"四字吓坏你,每个炒股票人其实都是专业赌徒。你在学习成为炒股专家,对自己的要求要高一些。这时出现另一问题。炒过股的朋友都会有这样的感觉:\"当我拥有某只股票的时候,我对它的感觉特别敏锐,股市每天算账,它让我打起十二分的精神,如果手中没拥有这只股票,我对它的注意力就不集中了。\"我自己有同样的问题,我的处理方式就是只留下一点股票,如100股。如果亏了,我就将它当成买药的钱,权当我买了贴让注意力集中的药。 家训:4、忘掉你的入场价。 坦白地讲,没有三五年的功力,交过厚厚的一大叠学费,要你忘掉进价是做不到的,但你必须明白为什么要这么做。今天你手中拥有的股票,按你的经验,明天都应该会升。如果经验告诉你这只股票的运动不对了,明天可能会跌,那你把它留在手中干什么？这和你在什么价位进价有什么关系？之所以难以忘掉进价,这和人性中喜赚小便宜,决不愿吃小亏的天性有关。如果这只股票的价位已较你的进价为高,你脱手会很容易,因为你已赚了便宜。若低的话,你须面对\"吃亏\"的选择！普通人会找一百个\"理由\"再懒一会儿。朋友,\"再懒一会\"的价钱很高的。人很难改变自己的人性,那就试着忘掉进价吧！这样你就能专注于正确的时间做正确的事。 家训:5、别频繁交易。 我开始专职炒股的时候,每天不买或卖上一次就觉得自己没完成当天的工作。我以炒股为生,不炒不就是没事干？这可是我的工作啊！结果我为此付出了巨额的学费。当经验累积到一定地步,你就会明白股市不是每天都有盈利机会的。你觉得不买不卖就没事干,缺少刺激,代价是每次出入场的手续费。除了手续费之外,每天买卖都带给你情绪的波动,冲散了冷静观察股市的注意力。可以这么说,在你留意跟踪的股票中,每天都有70%胜算的交易机会是骗人的。频繁交易常常是因为枯燥无聊。频繁交易不仅损失手续费,同时使交易的质量降低。(因此,呵,来中邮吧和大家聊聊吧,打发一下时间,不要专门想到买卖) 家训:6、不要向下摊平。 犯了错,不是老老实实地认错,重新开始,抱着侥幸心理,向下摊平,把平均进价降低,希望股票小有反弹就能挽回损失,甚至赚钱。这是常人的想法和做法,在这行,则是破产的捷径。一只股票最高达到每股45元。从45跌到35,很低了吧？是不是再补上2000股？再跌到25元,你准备怎么办？还往不往下摊？结果一路跌到每股10元。作为股票投资人,这样的好戏只要上演一出,你就全部被套牢,等它升回45元？或许有可能,但这是两年后还是二十年后才会发生的事则谁也说不清！如果永远不回去呢？这样被烫一次,你将不再有胆量继续炒股。假如幸运地市场给你一个解套的机会,你会马上套现把钱放在米缸里,还是天天摸到钱放心。再见了,又一位交了学费毕不了业的学股人。不要向下摊也可用另一种说法:第一次入场后,纸面上没有利润的话不要加码。(前面已经讲了,不要贪心没赚到最多),纸面有利润了,表示你第一次入场的判断正确,那么可以扩大战果,适当加注,否则你第一次入场的判断正确,那么可以扩大战果,适当加注,否则即刻止损离场,另寻机会。读者请静下心来思考一下为什么,道理其实很简单。也许有人不服气,我已有十次向下摊平都摊对了,它确是解套良方。我真要羡慕你,你的运气比我好多了。但你还未告诉我你第十一次、第十五次的结果！你敢保证次次都对？对炒股老手来讲,可以有很多例外。其中之一就是股票在升势时,任何点都是好的入场点,碰巧你一入场,股票开始正常下调,在下调结束回头的时候,你可以考虑再进点股,就算进价较你第一次进价为低也没有关系。这样做的思想基础不是为了解套,而是你\"知道\"股票的升势还在继续。只有将炒股武艺炼到\"无招\"地步的炒手才可以考虑这么做,没有三五年的经验莫谈。新手们谨请记住:不要向下摊平！\"补仓\"是投资者最大误区,是股市最大忌讳！ 家训:7、别让利润变成亏损。 这条规矩的意思是这样的:你10元一股进了1000股,现股票升到12元了,在纸面上,你已有2000元的利润。这时要定好止损价,价格应在10元之上,比如说不10.5元或11元,不要再让股票跌回9元才止损。你如果炒过股,就会明白当股票从10元升到12元,却让它跌回9元,最后割肉止损,其感觉是多么令人懊恼。你会觉得自己太愚蠢了！任何时候你如果有自己蠢的感觉,你一定做错了什么！把止损点定在11元,卖掉时算算还赚到钱,这和在9元时不得不割肉的感觉肯定是不一样的。这还牵涉到炒股的第一要务:保本！在任何情况下,尽量保住你的本金。(鞍钢从18元多到了21元,二天已经12%以上,当它到了19,5元时还不离开？)有些读者会问:股价是18元,把止损点定在17.9元,这样不就能保证赚得更多,数钱时更开心吗？说得是不错,但实际上不能这么做。股票波动一毛钱的时间有时不用两分钟,一旦你出场了,股票可能一路冲到20元,你就失去赚大钱的机会了。把止损点定在16.5元或17元,你给股票10%左右的喘息空间,一只正常上升的股票,不会轻易跌10%的。[多次强调:有钱赚不走最后还要亏那就不要玩了,当到了保本位置就平推掉当没有买过] 家训:8、跟着股市走,别跟朋友走！ 这条规矩的简单解释就是:别跟朋友买或卖,要按市场情况来买卖。我在交易大厅常常听到:\"你今天进了什么股票？我想跟你进点\"。在中邮基金吧里面好多人问,博士你说封闭基金好,我现在买封闭基金可以吗？每次听完我都觉得好笑,因为它总让我想起三个瞎子在前探路,随后一列跟着两位瞎子,三人排成一列。哈。。。瞎子喜欢带路的,第一位瞎子就不管了,反正大家都看不见。而三位眼睛好的行人往往是排成一行走,你走你的,我走我的,还方便聊天,碰到石头水沟时大家各自知道怎么避开。他们也有一列走的时候,那时他们走的路一定是最通畅的。一位真正懂炒股的人通常不愿别人跟着买,因为你可以跟我买,但我要卖的时候你不知道,结果可能害了你。如果卖股票时还要记着通知你,心理负担多大。亏的话怎么办？朋友,下点功夫,研究股票的运动规律,学着选择买点和卖点。想跟朋友买卖不要紧,掂掂他是什么材料。喜欢你跟着的通常本身是瞎子,瞎子喜欢带路的。(我博士不喜欢有人跟的。我说点什么以,也是为了想说明一个问题) 家训:9、该卖股票的时候,要当机立断,千万别迟疑！ 我在1994年11月2日的炒股日记上有这样一句话:股数2千,进价17.25,升到23.50,没有在21.50卖出,今跌到16.25,蠢啊蠢！！！痛啊痛！！！这是四年前的记录,我已记不清当时的具体情况,从上面的几句话,我知道自己将卖点定在21.50,当股票以23.50跌到21.50的时候,不知什么鬼原因使我迟疑,没有即时采取行动。在11月2日的时候,股票跌到16.25。我原保证8000元的利润,现倒亏2000元。我痛呼蠢啊蠢。股票波动从来花样百出,它在跌的时候,总会不时给你个小反弹,给你一线希望,让你觉得跌势已开始转头。股票重新下跌,你原来的希望破灭,准备割肉放弃时,它又来个小反弹,重新把你拴住。开始小小的损失,经过几个这样的来回,变成了大损失。这就是已学会\"止损\"的股友还会亏大钱的原因。止损的概念不要只体现在你的本金上,也要包括利在内。10元买进1000股,花了元的本,升到15,你手头就有元了。别把5000元仅当成纸面利润,不信的话就把股票卖掉,存入银行,看看多出的5000元是真钱还是假钱。定好了出场价,当股票跌到这点时,不要幻想,不要期待,不要讲理由,即刻卖掉再说。 家训:10、别将\"股价很低了\"当成买的理由,也别将\"股价很高了\"当成卖的理由！ 我今天手里还有只股票,五年前它从40元跌到25元,我觉得股价很低了,花了元进了1000股。现在的牌价是6.5元。我的元只剩下6500元。这只股票我一直没有止损,当年是\"不肯\",今天我用它来提醒自己:\"你永远不知股票会跌到多低！\"因为人是很健忘的。我发觉新手们特别喜欢买低价股,来请教我某只股票是否可买的朋友,他们选的股票大多是低价股。这低价是指股票从高价跌下来,如40元跌到25元。这样的想法或许是源自日常生活,衣服从45元降价到25元,那一定是偏宜了。把这样的习惯引伸到股票,自然而然地找\"减��股票\"。很不幸,你用选衣服的方法选股票,在这行就死定了。股票从45元跌到25元,通常都有它的内在原因,你用什么断定它不会继续往下跌呢？有句话是这么说的:别试着去接往下掉的刀子,它会把你的手扎得血淋淋的！所谓炒手,最重要的是跟势,股票从45元跌到25元,明显是跌势,你不能逆势而行。当然要是股票从45元跌到10元,现在又从10元升到25元,那就是两码事了。一位新手在发现他买进的股票升了时,会很兴奋,也惴惴不安,生怕市场把好不容易借给的利润又收回去。成日脑海里盘旋的就是\"股票是不是升到顶了\",\"还是别贪了,快快卖吧\"。这里要提醒读者的就是:别将\"股价很高了\"当成卖的理由,你永远不知股票会升多高。只要股票的升势正常,别离开这只股票。记住前面提到过的华尔街格言:截断亏损,让利润奔跑！[这也是投资者常见错误] 家训:11、市场从来不会错,你自己的想法常常是错的。 多少次,你拍着脑瓜子叫:\"见鬼,无论从什么角度分析,这只股票都没有理由会跌的,它很快就会反弹。\"我朋友来问股票,都会一条条列出他们的分析,最后认定这只股票升到顶了,那只股票跌到底了。我无法证明其对错,通常我只建议你若想买那就买吧,但若股票又跌了10%,即刻脱手。如果你想卖,那就卖吧,反正不卖你也睡不着。很多著名的专家,在这条上都翻了跟斗。人一旦出了点名,名声就重于一切,他们认为股票要升,不升怎么办？结论自然是市场错了,市场还未体验到这只股票的价值。结果是专家们一个个从宝座上跌下来。这样的故事非常之多。越聪明的人,越容易自以为是。他们在生活中的决定通常正确的居多,有些是开始不对劲,但最终证明他们正确。但在股票行,或许最终他们确实是正确的,但在市场证明之前,他们可能早已剃光头回家了。不要自以为是,不要有虚荣心,按市场给你的信息来决定行动计划,一有不对即刻认错,这才是股市的长存之道。(最近鞍钢碰到国家调整高能耗企业,又恰碰上出口退税政策调整,股价下了,如政策影响你认为非常大,则像上面提到的,止损出局,要不再看看下周,我博士不会为了名声而与钱过不去。)我不知道能完整仔细的看完以上整篇的人有多少,但我想有这种耐心去改变自己过去的思维,已经是一种战胜自己了。请回答,看完没有？",

Overcoming these challenges requires a significant amount of self-discipline and a willingness to learn from past mistakes. Investors need to develop a strategy and stick to it, even in the face of short-term losses. It is important to have a long-term perspective and to avoid becoming too focused on short-term gains or losses. Investors must also have patience and self-control, and be able to make decisions based on facts and not on emotions. Overcoming these psychological challenges requires a combination of knowledge, experience, self-discipline, and the ability to overcome personal biases and tendencies. It is a challenging process that requires a significant amount of time and effort. However, with the right attitude and approach, it is possible to achieve long-term success in the stock market.", "length": 21989}
{"text": "Fifty years ago, the TTC was considering a subway line that would begin on Queen Street downtown and run in an L-shaped route east and north to connect to the Danforth Subway. Initially this might be operated with streetcars, and later be converted to a subway. A variant on this scheme appears in a 1973 TTC drawing showing the line continuing north through Thorncliffe Park to Don Mills & Eglinton. This is not exactly a new idea, and it must be remembered that, at the time, there was a lot less of suburban Toronto than exists today.\nWhere Would a Queen Subway Go?\nWhere Would a Don Mills Subway Go?\nNeedless to say, these proposals sat on the shelf for various reasons. One big one was cost, especially as there were competing proposals for other lines like the Spadina and Yonge extensions. Technology debates were another issue, and at one point the line might have been built with the technology used for the Scarborough RT (including some appalling proposals for an elevated structure in the heart of downtown).\nA future reduction of subway headways using Automatic Train Control (ATC) to as low as 90 seconds (compared to the current 140).\nThe scheme for Bloor station has subsequently been abandoned because of its complexity, but there remains an idea to add a new platform at Yonge station (on the Bloor line) much as a second platform was added at Union. This would separate eastbound and westbound traffic onto separate platforms each with its own circulation elements to the Bloor station above.\nCome the 1990s, a major recession cut 20% off of TTC ridership, and the problem with subway crowding vanished. In this context, the idea of extending the line north ceased to regard capacity as a limitation, and momentum began to build for this option, especially in York Region.\nReducing headways to 90 seconds would yield a capacity increase of about 50% (40 trains per hour vs 26), and this supposed extra capacity was routinely cited by TTC management as a preferred alternative to the cost of a Relief Line. This argument continued well into the 2000s even as the Yonge line started to fill up with new and returning riders.\nThe new TR trains are already in service, and their additional capacity has been eaten up by latent demand on the subway. The ATC project now underway is expected to complete in 2019, but the TTC has now reduced its potential benefit to about 28% based on a minimum headway of 110 seconds, a substantial change from their earlier hoped-for 90 second headways.\nTraffic diversion to the extended Spadina line is limited, about the equivalent of one trainload of passengers in the peak hour. While the TYSSE will no doubt benefit York University as well as future developments in Vaughan, it will not do a lot to help with congestion problems on the Yonge line.\nThe headroom for growth assumed in the 2012 study has been consumed (TR trains) or reduced (ATC) pushing up the importance of a new line. Combined with the loss of ten years thanks to projected demand from a Yonge extension, what was once a distant project has assumed a new importance.\nBack in the 1980s, the congestion problem was viewed as having one place, and one site where a “solution” was required: Bloor-Yonge station. The situation today is much different in that demand flowing south on the Yonge line now causes backlogs of waiting passengers well north of Bloor, and this will not be helped by diverting riders around the Bloor-Yonge interchange. What is needed is the interception of riders before they even get to the Yonge line, and there are two options for this.\nThe route is comparatively slow, and significant works are required both to flood-proof the route and upgrade it for more frequent, bidirectional service. It is worth noting that this corridor is not part of the GO/RER network expansion now underway.\nTrain service from Richmond Hill now operates half-hourly in the peak period. Reducing this to a 15 minute headway would add only two GO trains’ capacity to the corridor. This is not trivial, but it is no panacea either. Frequent service north of the York Subdivision (the CN line parallel to Highway 7) must complete for track time with freight operations.\nFares on GO trains are not competitive with the TTC, and it is clear that York Region expects a “TTC fare” from Richmond Hill to downtown much as they will get a single fare from Vaughan Centre. Shifting traffic to GO is difficult when a more frequent and cheaper option is available.\nThe other is a line within Toronto paralleling the Yonge subway to the east much as the Spadina line does to the west. This is the extended version of the Relief Line (now dubbed the “Don Mills Subway”) that would run north to Sheppard. Although this line would be expensive to build, the projected diversion of traffic off of Yonge is very substantial according to the Metrolinx study.\nHowever, a problem remains on the Bloor-Danforth line where riders are unable to board during peak periods inbound at stations close to the core, especially on the Danforth side. Intercepting traffic that now feeds into the Danforth subway via buses with a subway line further north could reduce Danforth demand. Some reduction might also come from the “SmartTrack” service on GO/RER with rides at a TTC fare from Scarborough stations to the core.\nDiscussion of subway congestion focuses on the AM peak and inbound travel. However, there is a big problem outbound in the afternoon that additional subway capacity can address on the YUS line. But this will trigger a problem for the BD line at its transfer stations, Bloor-Yonge and St. George, where more frequent YUS service will now deliver riders at a faster rate wishing to transfer to outbound trains. Station capacity and transfer demand is not just an issue for the AM peak inbound, but for the PM peak as well.\nA similar problem will develop at the well-used stations south of Bloor where a 110 second headway of trains will deliver passengers to platforms at a rate 28% higher than today. Some of these stations are quite constrained for exit capacity, especially if pathways are constrained or out of service (e.g. for escalator repairs).\nIf the operating speed of a line can be increased, the number of trains to provide a given level of service drops, or more service can be provided with the same number of trains.\nThe TTC has settled on a “typical” operating speed for its trains ever since it abandoned “high rate” operation on the Bloor-Danforth subway many decades ago. This decision was taken because equipment then in use (the “H-1” trains) developed severe mechanical problems when run at high speed. Higher speed also increases the demands on track maintenance. Any change in operating speed requires (a) equipment capable of faster travel and (b) a decision to invest the necessary money in maintenance.\nStation dwell times can be reduced only if the demand for boarding and alighting goes down. This is achieved either through lighter demand (and less friction between passengers in cars and on platforms), or by separate loading and unloading platforms. Neither of these is practical for the existing system.\nTurnaround times are affected both by the track geometry at terminals (which dictates the length of time trains can block each other from entering and leaving), train length and operator behaviour. The latter can be a major problem if a crew is not ready to take a train out of the terminal when it is ready to leave. One Person Train Operation, a TTC goal, may trigger further problems because an operator will have to walk the length of the platform to change directions.\nTurnarounds are also affected by scheduling, and riders are already familiar with queues of trains that build up on the approaches to terminals. This arises from excessive scheduled running time and trains that typically arrive “early” with no platform available because earlier trains are waiting to depart. As scheduled headways get shorter, the ability of a line to absorb padded schedules will dwindle.\nThe TTC’s Fleet Plans for its subway lines do not provide for all of the potential changes, or at least not on a timely basis. There are two types of cars, the Toronto Rockets or TRs on YUS, and the T-1 cars on BD. Some T-1 cars formerly operated on the Sheppard line, but they have been replaced by 4-car TR sets.\nThe TTC’s fleet plan for YUS is shown in the table below which is taken from the 2017-2026 Capital Budget “Blue Books” Section 4.12 (Subway Car Purchases).\nThis plan shows an addition of six trains for the TYSSE’s opening, and that will provide service with every alternate train running through to Vaughan. The turnback point will likely be the pocket track at Finch West station.\nIn 2020-21, six trains are added to provide additional capacity and exploit ATC. Note that this is less than a 10% increase, not the 28% routinely touted for the post-ATC environment. The basic problem, as is evident in the chart, is that the TTC does not have enough trains to make a 28% increase in service on YUS. Therefore, it is not valid to claim that this represents headroom for ridership growth at least until more trains are procured. There is an unfunded $287 million project in the budget starting in the late 2020s to build up the fleet with 10 more trains. Note that 5 of these are earmarked in the plan above for introduction in 2027.\nOnce the TYSSE opens and the service requirement is 63 trains, a 28% increase would be 20 trains (including spares) less the buffer of 4 “contingency” trains available in 2017. Therefore, the TTC’s plans do not currently include enough equipment, even out to 2031, to fully exploit ATC or provide all of its claimed additional capacity.\nAdditional trains require storage space, and this will be provided both at Wilson Yard and at a new storage area at Richmond Hill station, but the latter would not be available until that extension (for which there are no trains in the plan above) opens.\nThe fleet plan for BD is rather odd in that it reflects a point when the Scarborough Subway was intended to open earlier than its now-projected 2026 date.\nA related problem is that the T1s would be expensive to convert to ATC operation, and yet the Scarborough extension will almost certainly be under ATC control. The TTC has not explained how they plan to deal with this situation. ATC conversion of the existing BD line is planned for the period immediately after the YUS project completes in 2019, and it would be completed before the SSE opens.\nThere is no room at Greenwood Yard for additional trains, and moreover “unit” trains like the TRs, which are planned for BD, will not fit in some of the existing yard and shop layout because Greenwood was designed around two-car sets.\nThe City/TTC are in the process of acquiring property for a new yard near Kipling Station, and this would substantially take over the function now provided by Greenwood for the BD line. The Capital Budget does not include any money for construction of the new carhouse. Depending on the timing of the new subway car order for BD, this facility could be needed in the early 2020s if the fleet is to be in place for opening of the SSE.\nTTC management expects to present a consolidated plan for renewal of Line 2 BD to the TTC Board in July 2017. The timing of projects within this plan will be critical as they will affect overall capital spending patterns and could bring projects that have been “parked” beyond the City’s ten-year planning window into the current period when funding is tight.\nWith the acquisition of the new TR trains for Line 4 Sheppard, there are no plans to increase service on this line in the foreseeable future.\nGreenwood also hosts part of the work fleet, and more could be based there once the BD line’s fleet is operating primarily from Kipling. Another potential use for Greenwood would be to host trains for a Relief line that would almost certainly use the shorter 4-car consist now seen on Sheppard.\nThe value of projects in the pipeline and on various wishlists considerably exceeds the available capital.\nCost sharing agreements with other governments, such as the Federal infrastructure program, can trigger the need for the City to pony up its share for projects that it might not yet have included in its spending projections.\nThere is a bulge in approved capital spending that prevents the addition of any new projects to the pipeline from 2018 until the early 2020s unless additional tax revenue, borrowing room or external funding becomes available.\nThese considerations affect not just transit projects, but all capital works the City might undertake notably major road projects or renovation of public housing stock. This article has reviewed the situation for subway lines, but there is a long queue of transit and non-transit projects threatened by the City’s funding limitations.\nThe situation is not unique to Toronto, and both provincial and federal programs push a lot of their proposed funding into the future when, they hope, financial times will be better and they can afford to be generous. But spend today? Not happening.\nA common refrain heard during budget debates is that the City should simply let the private sector take over the projects. This is not necessarily a good idea because the private sector cannot borrow as cheaply as the City and typically wants to make money on anything it does invest on the City’s behalf. Also, there is a substantial layer of cost and complexity to managing the contract that must be measured against any imputed savings from the partnership. These arrangements are not a one-size-fits-all solution, and in any event deal with marginal savings on projects, not on the much larger overall funding needs of big ticket items like a Relief line. Partnerships are a financing mechanism, a way to offload some of the immediate costs of borrowing and to transfer some risks associated with project delivery to a separate entity. But there will remain the ongoing cost of paying for that investment and its operation.\nHow Quickly Could We Build?\nA common question about the Relief line (or any other big project) is “why should this take so long”, especially when we see cities elsewhere in the world building new lines at a much faster rate. Part of the answer is technical – local geology and construction complexity – and part can simply be the benefit of a city having an established tradition and team of building that just never stops.\nBut a big part of the problem is financial. Toronto’s endless debates about rapid transit spending have always had a “who goes first” quality to them. Everyone wants their project to be at the head of the queue because they “deserve” the first of any new transit spending. Sheppard West station (formerly Downsview) exists simply because it was common to competing demands for a subway extension either north to York U, or east along Sheppard (a perennial favourite of local Councillors who talk of a “North York Relief Line” with straight faces). One of the hoped-for benefits of the Transit City Plan, leaving aside the debates over technology, was that it put many lines on the map at one go, with the intention that they all be built in a timeframe people could believe in. Alas, that was not to happen, and we are left with a Scarborough megaproject elbowing everything else out of its way.\nToronto should be able to build a Relief line in less than 14 years, but this would require the commitment of political capital (“this is a city building project”), and investment on an accelerated scale. The Crosstown project includes 10 kilometres of tunnel and many underground stations, and it is not taking 14 years to build.\nThe question that should be asked is this: if we wanted “Relief” sooner, would it be possible? What prevents us from having a new line in, say, 10 years? The answers may not be palatable in that the folks who are squashed onto subway cars never seem to be around when blowhards campaign against “runaway taxes”. If Council really does not care to improve transit, except in the backyards of a few key wards, then it should say so.\nBut as long as any newfound money is immediately blown on this week’s pet project, Toronto will always wonder why the things we need never get built.\nThis entry was posted in Downtown Relief Line, Transit, Yonge Subway Extension. Bookmark the permalink.\nLets hope whatever plans are drawn up are better than the corner cutting “pet plans” of the past which have left the door wide open. Funding should be the number one priority as we should already have a good idea of what the next wave of plans will ultimately be even if they are neutered to slight altered.\n“Relief” should have been delivered already. But, as Steve tells us, the political so often gets in the way.\nEven if relief is delivered in the east with the “Relief” line, further extension to Shepard is needed. This is what builds a network. If not, the pressure on YUS above Eglinton continues. The idea of further expansion to York would only put more pressure on the line.\nThe idea of network is sadly lacking in Toronto, it’s fine to think we can build a subway to Richmond Hill, but what happens when the line is down. Connectively needs to be enhanced when plans are put forward.\nThe TTC will also have to do platform doors if they want to run 110 seconds headway. When platforms are crowded, accidents happen. If one person falls on to the tracks, it will be a massive delay on the system. Platform doors also make the platforms slightly larger as people will no longer have to stand behind the yellow line. They can stand right up to the platform door safely.\nMr. Tory is taking a stand that the relief line must happen before the Line 1 extension. However, he will now has to find the money. No one knows how much money Mr. Tory is on the hook for. When Smart Track is finished, the city might have to pay GO to carry passengers inside Toronto. Why would someone board a GO train at Centennial GO, when boarding at Unionville will be much cheaper at a TTC fare? Will the TTC pay Metrolinx to run trains (or track time) on Smart Track portion of the tracks? Will the TTC pay GO a subsidy so that customers boarding at Unionville pay a TTC fare instead of a GO fare?\nEvery level of government seems to have their own transit portfolio to fund. Even if the federal government spends $50 billion on VIA Rail, it still won’t be enough. $50 billion might buy just a high speed corridor between Windsor and Quebec City. The Canadian and Ocean might still not be a daily train. Nova Scotia wants a daily service between Halifax and Moncton in addition to the Ocean. There are so many competition for money everywhere in the country. Mr. Tory will have a lot of work convincing the federal and provincial government. Mr. Trudeau does not come to Toronto and say “let’s build, we got your back”. Ms. Wynne won’t spend any money because she wants a balanced budget forever (or at least until another Liberal majority).\nWhile relief may come in 10 years, we are taking a long time to build anything. In Riyadh, 6 metro lines will be completed by 2019 and those were only approved in 2013. If Toronto wants to have transit fast, stop on insisting on underground tunnels. Guideways are much easier to build and faster to finish. Cut and cover construction will also be much faster, but it is taboo now. The Paris Metro was built this way.\nTransit might simply be too big and difficult for municipal politicians to deal with.\nBy all means the funding from senior governments is inadequate but what Steve points out as political obstacles mainly comes from city council. Indeed if they can say with a straight face North York Relief Line well.. I don’t have much hope.\nI am glad Steve you point out the inherent problems with the private sector and indeed financing is a big one. We are going through this in Ottawa where we now know thanks to the work of some on city council that it would have been cheaper to finance this ourselves. Another issue is once you sign a contract with a private company to build and maintain (operations remains with the city) it’s difficult for us citizens to know what’s going on and how the money is spent.\nAs much as I don’t like the idea of shifting transit to the Province (there are drawbacks) I am beginning to rethink my views.\nPlanning in Ottawa just like Toronto was plagued by the pet projects of councillors (we were saved only because the BRT was built over 25 years ago but that too causes problems) and by moneyed interests.\nCadillac Fairview demanded and got a station at its shopping mall. Yes it’s nice it serves the Byward Market but the geology there makes it hard to build and I suspect hard to maintain. We don’t know because they won’t tell but their silence is deafening.\nSo I hope Toronto won’t do the same mistakes we did. But I suspect that it’s the same political game in either cities.\nSteve: The last thing Toronto will want is a provincial upload once Queen’s Park says “fine, but here is the amount we expect you to contribute to the TTC’s operation” just as they now ask for money toward GO Transit’s capital program. It is quite amusing to thing that Queen’s Park would take on local transit for free. Another important point is that service standards would then be dictated by the province, and would likely be considerably worse than the level of service Toronto now expects. We could get more, but there would be a fee.\nAwesome analysis so I hesitated before mentioning this but OPTO is not an issue at least when it comes to reversing trains.\nMontréal and other systems simply have an operator at each end to assist in the reversing process. It’s quick.\nStill, spectacular analysis. Many lessons to be learned.\nSteve: An operator who was at the “east” end of a train still has to walk to the “west” end. Unless sufficient extra staff are provided so that this does not hold up service, it will be an issue. This will also be a problem for emergency turnbacks enroute as well as “on the fly” crew changes between trains.\nUh-huh. So how do the people on the train, who want to get off, actually get off?\nSteve you are right Queen’s Park would rather not take over, not directly but it’s meddling a lot and we are paying more and more for less and less. So they are already putting a lot of conditions in order to get funding and it’s not good. Maybe the TTC is free of such interference but in Ottawa they meddle plenty and not just with Presto.\nThis is the context that leads me to change my views about who should run transit.\nAs for operator change I agree with emergencies and operational flexibility but in terminals they don’t walk. The incoming operator gets out while the terminal operator takes over. The terminal operator runs ands stops near the end of the train so that the incoming operator gets in the cab at the end of the train. They reverse the train and the terminal operator gets out. He or she is the only one to walk and that is across the tracks. This makes rotating crews easier and gives them breaks. The father of a friend of mine used to operate for the STM and he loved it. He hated line 4 which had an operator at each end because the breaks were few and far between compared to the other lines. There’s probably a YouTube video that shows how it’s done.\nBut in an emergency having that second crew member counts. So it’s not a straightforward decision to remove the second crew member.\nI am glad to see the issue of construction cost and speed finally getting some attention. If we were able to build as quickly and as cheaply as say, oh just about any city in Europe, then a lot of these “who goes first and where” debates wouldn’t happen in the first place.\nSteve has previously written about why it’s hard to directly compare construction costs. However the latest estimates I read in the press for the Scarborough and Relief lines make me shake my head – they appear to be setting a world record on a per km basis, with the exception of the 2nd Avenue subway in New York, the cost of which has been widely derided.\nP.S. I’ve always wondered why Toronto subways crawl along at roughly 50 km/hr or less, Steve explained why above. Hardly “rapid” transit, and something I find irritating as a frequent user.\nBenny Cheung Writes: The Canadian and Ocean might still not be a daily train.\nSorry to stray off topic but as far as the Canadian is concerned, this this has as much to do with running rights through the Rockies and the Rocky Mountaineer’s interference as it does VIA’s budget. You think VIA wants to run 30-car trains? No amount of money will fix that unless you want to build new track through the mountains. A little strong arm is necessary.\nAn important part of honesty in subway planning is to dump the “one silver bullet” attitude and develop a network thinking attitude. This means thinking about how everything works together and how each project affects the entire network.\nFor example, Mayor Tory is right to point out that there is no capacity on the Yonge subway for the additional passengers that would arrive as a result of any subway extension to York Region. However, the exact same thing is true about the Eglinton Crosstown, and I do not see Mr. Tory vowing to block the opening of the Crosstown until the Relief Line is completed.\nThe reality is that as soon as the Eglinton Crosstown opens, there will be a large number of people riding on it from east of Yonge to the Yonge subway. But when they arrive at the Yonge subway there will not be capacity available for them. OOps!\nDuring the AM peak, anyone trying to board at any station south of Eglinton will be out of luck. The problem is that there are currently a lot of people south of Eglinton who rely upon the Yonge subway to get to work. Rest assured, they will be mightily unhappy about no longer being able to get to work.\nAlthough I generally dislike Karen Stintz, she did understand how to build a subway. You call a meeting, you vote for a city-wide tax increase to pay for a subway, and then you agree to build it. Of course, the Scarborough subway was later found to be way more expensive than originally projected, but I admit that she was able to set things in motion quickly. No one is going to take John Tory’s talk about the Relief line seriously until he’s willing to do something like that himself.\nToday’s New York Times has a story about having to convince the state governor to do something for the NYC Subway since he is in charge.\nThey need to upgrade (what they call) a 1930s signalling system. One line done last year, one for this year; they say it may take 50 years to do the whole system at that rate.\nOne line last year and one for this year?\nThe 10-mile Canarsie Line (L service) was chosen as the pilot upgrade to CBTC, with work beginning in 2000 and completed about the end of 2006. It was chosen as the pilot partly because it is a relatively short line and partly because only one route uses the line. The second CBTC upgrade was the Flushing line (and its 2015-opening extension), which like the Canarsie line, is home to only one route (7 and its express). This had a slightly shorter implementation time span, being covered in the capital budgets from 2010 to 2014, though additional work continued a little longer for the extension.\nGranted, lessons learned on these projects will enable future projects to proceed in less time, but there is a significant amount of time needed to re-signal a line.\nAnd yes, NYC has a fair bit of 1930-era components in their signalling system. Aside from parts not being available (though, lines being upgraded will free up some equipment for that purpose), much of the wiring has cloth insulation. If there was a fire in a signalling equipment room, it would make the recent hydro vault fire here in Toronto look like a campfire by comparison.\nIt is clear to all that the Yonge line (Finch to Union) is running from near to beyond capacity. Adding the connection to the Eglinton LRT (EgLRT), and building the SSE will only add to the problem.\nThe major choke point is Yonge/Bloor, as it is the main transfer from N-S to E-W.\nSteve: Actually, there is a choke point north of Bloor too that grows worse as demand coming in from the north rises. Elimination/redirection of trips that now attempt to transfer at Bloor-Yonge will affect both crowding at the interchange for transfers, and relieve demand on the line further north, provided that the DRL goes far enough, as you note below.\nAll the relief that the Spadina arm can provide with the extension to VMC is a few train loads. All the studies show the only true relief will come from building the Don Mills (DMS) line.\nSection 1 – Queen to Pape is starting to get priority, Section 2 – Pape to Eglinton is starting to be a planning priority, Stage 3 – Eglinton to Don Mills is still a gleam in Steve’s eye, Stage 4 Don Mills to York Region is crayon on paper.\nSteve: I think pushing north of Sheppard is a real stretch today, and the question remains of how much capacity can be squeezed out of the GO Richmond Hill corridor if we are willing to spend the money on it. There is also the question of whether we should simply keep building subway further north, or look again at the idea of an LRT network for York Region.\nBut York Region is starting the push for the Richmond Hill extension to the Yonge line – to me it would see more logical to look for an extension to the north (DMS stage 4) from Don Mills to Steeles (dip under the 404 and run north under Woodbine to 7?), as a better long term goal. Having both York and Toronto on the same page, not working at cross purposes would result in construction, not conflict.\nBuilding the DMS is a necessity, but will take time (20+) to build. So I ask what short term pressure outlets can we find/implement?\nMost of the transfers at Yonge/Bloor are N to E/W and E to N/S, most western riders are assumed to change at Spadina or St. George and ride around to avoid the “hassle” at Y/B.\n1. A shuttle bus from Rosedale station via Crescent Road, to Sherbourne Street (Sherbourne Station w transfer), to Wellesley Street (Wellesley Station ) and run back the same way again. This would be a continuous loop, running express from station to station to station. This offers an alternate N/E, S/E and E to N/S connection.\n2. Extend the streetcar tracks on Parliament to Castle Frank station. Looping via Queen, Victoria, Dundas or King, Wellington. York, Queen would provide the E/S and S/E link. By wrapping the streetcars in custom livery (red rockets with flames on the back) they could run express from the core to Castle Frank to provide a competitive link. I like streetcars and this could be done with buses, but the streetcars give more capacity with lower headway.\nSteve: Both of these suffer from capacity limitations and from the problem that the transfer point is too close to Yonge. That is particularly important for outbound trips that would attempt to board at Sherbourne or Castle Frank where trains are already packed. An “express” streetcar from Castle Frank is not really going to be very fast because it will run in mixed traffic on Parliament.\n3. Victoria Park BRT to Markham. Running from Victoria Park station to some point in Markham (Hwy 7?) this would provide a eastern link running N/S that could easily tie into EgLRT and reduce pressure on line 1. Transfer pressure may increase at Y/B or St. G/B interchanges, but this should lower loading on the north Yonge trains. The advantage to this route lies in the fact that it can be implemented quickly and stay up and running, undisturbed by construction of the northern stages of the DMS line.\nSteve: Reducing pressure on Line 1 by connecting to the Eglinton LRT? Er … and just how is putting passengers on Eglinton supposed to help the Yonge line? If they come down to the BD line, they just add to the problems from the Danforth subway.\n4. Build the Sheppard line to connect with the York-Spadina arm of the YUS. Split the line north of Wilson so half of the trains run to VMC and half go to Don Mills. This is a long term goal of TTC schedulers and maintenance to ease running the YUS, but it would increase ridership on the Sheppard and York/University lines. Build DMS stage 4, and you have a circuitous route to downtown. And with the Sheppard line tied directly to the Spadina arm, would the transfer at Yonge/Sheppard be worth it?\n5. Double track Go Richmond Hill line for 2-way operation to Old Cummer (Langstaff if possible 3 or 4 track to keep CN happy), run this as an all-day service at TTC x 2 rates as this would be a premium direct to core route as an upcharge is viable. Load levels may allow single track operation with a RDC type unit.\nSteve: If the load levels are low enough that RDCs running at the headways a single track could support will not make a dent in demand on the Yonge line.\n6. Convert the old CP line from Union to Leaside (Eglinton/Leslie) the same way, but run at TTC rates to encourage EgLRT riders to bypass the Yonge line for the faster ride to Union and ride North from there.\nSteve: There are big problems from Leaside eastward because this is the CPR’s main line.\n7. Get GO to fast-track RER on the Unionville line. Ask them to focus on full day service to at least Agincourt, again this provides another eastern link running N/S to draw off more ridership.\nSteve: Work on double-tracking parts of this line is already underway, but there are issues where GO parallels the SRT about the amount of room available for concurrent operation. The SRT is to remain in service until the SSE opens in 2026 (if you believe in the tooth fairy).\nI am not saying we could do any or all of these, but it is a starting point for discussion.\nOn a different note, while a DMS stage 2 route is expected to be Pape to Thorncliffe to Flemingdon Park to Don Mills – this route requires one, maybe two expensive bridges. Could Pape to O’Connor to Victoria Park – requiring one bridge be a cheaper alternative.\nI am not sure of bridge vs tunnel cost, so I ask. Possibly this route is too easterly and would steal ridership from the GO RER/Smart-track line to STC.\nHowever it would make turning into Don Mills easy, or allow Spanish style stations at Sheppard and Victoria Park to allow easy transfer to the Sheppard line and make train turnaround timing simpler.\nIf York Region had to forgo the Yonge extension, and had to opt for a more eastern link, would they choose, Don Mills, Victoria Park, or further east?\nSteve: You would take a more roundabout route and would miss several key centres: Thorncliffe, Flemingdon and the Don Mills/Eglinton corner which is about to have major redevelopment. Your schemes seem bent on providing service to York Region when the real issue is to increase capacity to handle demand within Toronto itself, and particularly for trips that are not just downtown-oriented commutes.\nOn the bridge vs tunnel question, bridges are almost certainly cheaper, especially considering how deep the valley is.\nThanks again for distilling complexities and crises to simpler principles and problems, along with some denunciations along the way.\nIt is complex, and I’ve held off adding two cents until I think I’ve gotten points a bit more than a skim.\nI sadly am no longer trusting the outcomes of planning/scheming processes; a review/reset of the large-scale plans by a group like APTA or UITP would be very very good value for any money spent, and with the billions of public dollars possibly squandered, where are some fiscal conservatives when you might like some?\nI’m thinking we need new corridors vs. continual overload of existing ones, and also, we need to have faster routes (often on-surface when possible), and on existing corridors or remnants (where possible), and done far more quickly to respond to the current overload/crisis vs. maybe in 15 years if there’s funding. The taint and problems of the Suspect Subway Extension are ongoing, and this includes the adjustments to plans and priorities from salvaging up to some credibility the Smart Track layer of the RER.\nWe are firmly ignoring the possible usage of the Richmond Hill GO line and the Don Valley and some corridors there because of the possible floodings, which relates to the great surges in the stormwaters due to all the hard surfaces in the watershed, which is around 1200 sewers and c. 70% of storm surge according to a recent book Reclaiming the Don by Bonnell. The majority of the Council voted to do nothing for another couple of years; close to the same votes as the majority that voted to ignore facts when doing infrastructure projects ie. whims and whatever, are just fine for billions worth of spending.\nIt isn’t merely the GO line, which may be less easy thanks. There is a remnant spur line in a bit of North Toronto that is a bike trail now – and it’s a shortcut. I don’t know it/environs that well, but if we’re ignoring it because of the rich areas that it runs through, that’s not OK. Also, we apparently own the spur line from Brickworks south to near-core, with a bridge over the Don, and a fair bit of land adjacant to the Don Valley Parkway. So one surface relief measure/idea I’ve been seeing is re-use of that spurline, perhaps for bi-directional relief, despite the narrow bridge (which signalling may allow use of), to get near Thorncliffe Park, and have a Redway transitway to link up to Thorncliffe.\nSteve: I really have to jump in here. There is no “remnant” spur line — it has been a bike path for over a decade. When it did have track, it was single track and had a level crossing with Lawrence just east of Leslie that would be difficult to eliminate given the geography of the location close to the intersection. Reactivating this would put frequent service right through the middle of a residential neighbourhood. It’s income level does not matter, although I am amused that you of all people would advocate getting rid of a bike path. Maybe we should rip out like the West Toronto Railpath or the path on the west side of the Don beside the Bala Sub if it would suit your plans.\nThat narrow bridge must be replaced as it is not structurally sound.\nThe biggest problem operationally is the need for anything coming up the Don Branch (the ex-CPR line on the east side of the valley) to cross the CPR’s mainline at Leaside to reach the former spur.\nThis has all been covered many times, and quite bluntly I am fed up with how often this resurfaces as a “solution” including on some professional produced maps.\nFurther flights of imagination are a new bridge to the centre of the DVP from Thorncliffe Park to create a loop, and use/re-use the DVP for transit as there is a relative LOT of land there, and we could maybe drop in a centre-lane reversible transitway modelled along Jarvis St. lines. If it works for a few cars/people on Jarvis, why not have this same idea for more efficient transit?? (“Because” is not an adequate answer, though our broad carruption is such that I’m sure some people will be quite happy giving that answer).\nThis piece of Relief would bypass Bloor/Danforth yes, but isn’t that a Good Thing?\nAnd with another bridge (transit-only, though maybe bikes/bladers/boarders/peds too), if we got something faster/surface up to Thorncliffe Park, (which has high transit demand/use), we are quite close to Don Mills Road at Eglinton. So maybe we could drop in an LRT, or a busway to have higher-capacity surface transit zip in to the core for surface Relief, done faster.\nOf course if one looks at a map, and if one could imagine another bridge, from Thorncliffe to points east and northeast, there’s another very broad, wide, really sparsely used corridor that shall have no name, but it seems like a comparatively cheap and easy way to enable faster surface transit even within Scarborough, along with the inherent virtue of faster travel by the diagonality of it.\nWe could also boost express buses, and to be really roadical, we could analyze the people flows on the Yonge St. corridor ie. subway, road, sidewalks, and tally up fees paid for the relatively mobility, and we might realize that actually the subway riders pay an awful lot of coin for below-ground travel, and the clogged streets are given to vehicles that some can see as road hogs. So we could drop in a Jarvis-inspired transitway in some parts of Yonge, and even where it’s very narrow c. St. Clair, maybe Davisville), we should be able to prioritize transit on-street, at least during rush hours, and give up the central space/lane for deliveries and a bit of on-street parking when the subway is slightly more operational.\nAnd yes, bikeways might help, though far less on Yonge St., but more likely on Danforth and on Bloor, and we could also see/use something east-west in extending Richmond/Adelaide.\nOf course there are some other things: but the 1/3 of “Relief” (compared to the 1985 DRL) that might be arising with the Relief stubway, is absolutely NOT going to fix things on the Yonge line NofBloor, yet it really does need help/options. And it’s good to have the extra ‘misses’ of not enough trains for ATC, and oh, it’s another cost for this and that, including altering the B/Y platform for some massive sums, sometime. And meanwhile,the City can’t manage repainting a tiny bit of Bloor St. E. between Sherbourne and Church for about $25,000 that was in the 2001 Bike Plan, and is one of those missing links that discourages more than a few cyclists. The current crowd of rulers seems to not want bikeway relief, and it smells like the bikes are too much of the competition/good value, so it’s just fine to keep it dangerous as the City/TTC makes money from the overcrowding in the core etc. to help support suburban services.\nGoing back to a review, what a shame that the $150M for the ‘planning’ of the DRL can’t be tithed to the APTA for a good funded review of everything, to make sure we have planning that isn’t smelling tainted, which is a shame to say, as we’re getting towards planning, and there’s sure been a LOT of work put into things. But Fordwards was so so backwards, it’ll take at least this term to emerge from it; too bad the current leaders can’t smell as much off as some of us.\nGraham writes: 1. A shuttle bus from Rosedale station via Crescent Road, to Sherbourne Street (Sherbourne Station w transfer), to Wellesley Street (Wellesley Station ) and run back the same way again. This would be a continuous loop, running express from station to station to station. This offers an alternate N/E, S/E and E to N/S connection.\nHave you actually tried this out? While transferring to a bus at Rosedale and Wellesley stations isn’t too bad, Sherbourne is an awful transfer that requires a traipse up several flights of stairs and then crossing the street to catch a southbound bus on Sherbourne. The layout is already inconvenient for patrons of the 75 Sherbourne bus, many of whom make the perilous dash across several lanes of traffic plus bicycle lanes instead of walking the extra distance to cross with the light at Bloor. Why anyone would “volunteer” to transfer at Sherbourne is a mystery to me.\nCrescent Road is full of four-way stops. Wellesley Street east of Yonge regularly gets jammed with traffic both eastbound and westbound. That “express” loop will take maybe fifteen minutes if you’re lucky.\nTo add to Steve’s point about capacity, in peak hours there’s a train roughly every 150 seconds on both Yonge and Bloor lines. You are only going to make a decent dent in the crowds if you can convince, at a minimum, say 150 people to use this “transfer-bus” scheme. That’s two buses worth, so now you’re trying to run shuttle buses on a 75 second headway. Leaving aside the reactions of Rosedale residents along Crescent Road to the prospect of a continuous stream of buses (under 40 seconds for a bus in one direction or another), I can assure you from experience that trying to load 75 people onto an Orion VII, using all-door boarding, is going to take longer than your headway to accomplish. Even more if others are trying to get off the bus.\nI know that Steve rightly criticizes fantasy transit schemes drawn up on a napkin. (Someone elsewhere is proposing joining up the Sheppard subway, Don Mills line, and the notional Jane LRT in a giant U, for example.) But at least they are a vision of a utopian system, assuming money was no object. This scheme of making people take a bus to transfer between subway lines is a miserable one; the experience will be miserable for riders; it will take more time for the totally miserable experience….seriously, how would anyone expect anyone to “volunteer” for this experience?\nThanks for comment space, and comments. I’ve been a skunk within the bike community at times for things like advocating (or being OK with) squeezing the Rail Trail on the Weston line IF we could get adequate TTC-based transit AND a good on-street bike network in the west end as highest-best use of scarce land likely is, and should be, for transit. That said, the Rail Trail is a delight at times, but perhaps the eventual solution is to have the bike path atop a transit usage. Some century….\nAnd so yes, with that shortcut that is now a bike path in mid-Toronto, if it helps improve the transit, we need to add it in to the mix of options possible.\nAlso, there is likely real decay within that bridge structure by the Brickworks, but the base looks nearly indestructible, though if neglect at the top of the piers continues, that’s destructive. But much of our transit work is doing construction work and using concrete, so we have to think of having big works occur.\nAnd what’s the phrase – where there’s a will, there’s a way? I know it doesn’t apply to better biking (for the most part); and the fetish for subways is to remove transit usages from above ground and the road, as roads are for cars, right?\n#1 – With all of those residential buildings in Thorncliffe Park, where/how would you tunnel underneath that little “raised” island of a neighbourhood?\n#2 – Where would your portal be on the Thorncliffe Park side if you did a bridge?\nThe “Don Valley” is literally like a Grand Canyon between traditional East York (O’Connor and south) and Thorncliffe/Flemingdon Park.\nSteve: I would aim at a roughly diagonal path entering at the southwest side of Thorncliffe and swinging more northerly under the parking lot and mall building. It should be remembered that there is a good chance this project would trigger some reconstruction of the commercial space and we should not make assumptions about the buildings. It’s tight but not impossible, although construction close to the surface (as implied by a bridge) might be cut and cover which requires a finesse between existing buildings. From Overlea and Thorncliffe Park East, I would go under the road until a point where it would be possible to swing north behind Marc Garneau Collegiate to wind up under Don Mills.\nThere is more than one way to draw this path, and I’m not going to get into the details. That’s what we have engineers for. However when I consider places the subway already has bridges — Rosedale Valley Road, Humber River, Sheppard East at the Don, and on the YSE over the Don River in York Region (proposed), this is not a show stopper.\n#3 – I know it would be very very very deep but is it possible to just tunnel under and have a super-deep station (a la Tube in London) in Thorncliffe Park or would the environmental impact be much more severe trying to tunnel under the Don?\n#4 – Would the incline be too steep for a subway car if you had to tunnel beneath the Don through Thorncliffe Park as you curve up into Don Mills heading to Eglinton?\nSteve: I don’t know the elevations, but suspect this would be a big problem. Also a super-deep Thorncliffe Station is probably a bad idea both for cost and accessibility considering how busy it will be.\nI’m not a geologist and I know the area well… the section that has the highest “per km” construction cost will be as you head out the ridge north of O’Connor until the DRL reconnects somewhere under Don Mills Road. It will be interesting to see how they tackle it without making everything look like a total eyesore.\nJohn Tory just announced today that Roadway construction will be accelerated on several projects, at a cost premium of about 20% in order to reduce inconvenience.\nMaybe they can use cut-and-cover to reduce construction time. This would likely save ~50%, instead of costing more as it does for the roadway construction. Look at Eglinton – station construction is (or soon will be) ~150m long and spaced every 800m. This is a massive amount of disruption and the entire corridor may as well be a giant construction zone. May as well have the stations much shallower so they can be completed quicker.\nWith the money estimated for DRL short, they could likely get up to Sheppard if Value Engineering was allowed to find true savings.\nShort term relief can be provided by moving all the Flexities to be shared between the 505 Dundas and 504 King routes until we have more of those. Sure, the streetcars are slower but a lot of people will take them for a more spacious and convenient ride with nice clear views vs being squeezed in an underground tunnel.\nI remember a while back people were complaining on this blog when Scarborough residents were objecting to their houses being demolished for the subway and several people on this blog said ‘take it or leave it’ but now for the DRL, the subway is being moved from Pape to a more expensive Carlaw just because as the Citynews news report said, “it will change the character of the neighbourhood” (no demolition of any house threatened on Pape, no noise/vibration issues as new subway will be very deep, but “it will change the character of the neighbourhood”). Why can’t we say now, ‘take it or leave it’? You see the double standard? In Scarborough’s case, houses were threatened with demolition but on Pape, there is no demolition threat and only that “it will change the character of the neighbourhood” and off we move to a more expensive Carlaw option (the Citynews report said that the Carlaw option will be more expensive). Steve himself has stated that the Pape option is the best but I don’t see him condemning the Carlaw option now. As for me, I will support a DRL on Pape or further east but NOT under Carlaw. Why don’t we charge the extra cost of moving to Carlaw to the residents of Pape who don’t want to “change the character of their neighbourhood”? And why did they wait so many years to make that claim (the later the decision to move to Carlaw, the more expensive)?\nSteve: I don’t ever remember endorsing the Pape option in this context, and actually prefer the Donlands route that has been discarded earlier in the study. As for the issue with houses at Ellesmere and McCowan, I have never espoused a “take it or leave it” attitude. My big problem with the SSE is that we don’t need it, something that cannot argued for the DRL. While we are on the subject of extra costs, there is the little matter of an extra $150 million for a relocated bus terminal at STC. The size and complexity of this terminal is a direct result of the “one stop subway” option that concentrates all surface connections at STC rather than spreading them between locations.\nYou love to slag positions I have not actually taken in your continued portrayal of coddled downtowners versus downtrodden Scarborough residents. Get your facts straight.\nI hope that people will remember in the election next year that Kathleen Wynne’s Liberals have announced building a Toronto-Windsor high speed train but NOT the DRL. In the decade and a half that the Liberals have been in power, they could have built and opened a DRL already if they had any intention of doing so. Surely, the NDP and the Progressive Conservatives did not build it either but now, we have new leaders for both of those parties and not the ones that lead those parties to power in the past.\nSteve: Don’t hold your breath for big transit spending from the Tories. As for the NDP, the last time they were in power was a quarter century ago, and their transit “policy” consisted of make work projects to build subways, most of which were cancelled by Mike Harris. Only Sheppard survived to placate Mel Lastman and gain his support for Toronto’s forced amalgamation.\nThis isn’t as much of a subway planning question as it is an LRT planning question…it’s also local in character. Do you know whether any bus line (or corridor consisting of multiple bus lines) in Etobicoke has the passenger numbers to warrant a conversion to LRT?\nKipling has always struck me as wide enough to have an LRT line down the middle…buses are pretty full…but what are the actual numbers?\nSteve: Kipling is busy with a headway below 4′ in peak periods, but that’s light for LRT (15 regular size buses/hour is only 750-800 pax/hour). There is lots of room there for improvement as a bus operation. When the Transit City network was being planned, Kipling was considered but discarded because there were other stronger corridors.\nAlso, does it make any sense to run an LRT west from Kipling Station? To say, Sherway and beyond? Sherway Gardens is served rather poorly by transit. I know long ago there were ideas to extend the BD line this way but that they didn’t add up. The area around Kipling Station is urbanizing at pace in the past few years (The Kip District is the newest project to add to this), not all of those people are going to have cars (I didn’t when I lived in the area), and the Sherway/North Queen strip is the closest shopping destination, but getting there by bus is a bit of a pain.\nSteve: At one point, the Dundas BRT in Mississauga might have been an LRT, but that has sort of fallen off of the table. One big problem is that the BRT corridor is not longer actually on a street, and it also collects together many routes and does not act as a trunk in its own right. If Dundas were to become LRT, it really needs to generate a lot of its demand locally, not from many feeders. There is also the question of where a logical western end would be. As for Sherway, that’s another destination entirely well away from Dundas. There are big problems in designing/choosing major corridors in Etobicoke and Mississauga because of the suburban concentration (or lack of it) around which transit corridors might be built.\nDoug Said: I remember a while back people were complaining on this blog when Scarborough residents were objecting to their houses being demolished for the subway and several people on this blog said ‘take it or leave it’ but now for the DRL….\nJabs fly West to East only here. Any questioning portrays you as flaming a “downtown vs. suburb” debate. Yet when Steve says “we” don’t need a subway extension in Scarborough I question who is “we”? Certainly not the overwhelming voting majority in Scarborough. “We” is actually the opinions of “them” and “they” clearly have refused to work with Scarborough in anyway because “they” could care less about anything aside from their unfunded projects and cant move on to see the issues which led to the death of Transit City. So who is really flaming the divide? “We” actually don’t need poor transfer locations in Scarborough.\nThanks for your answers, Steve!\nI have been reading this blog for a long time and continue to be fascinated by the breadth and detail of its content, the depth of the analysis and the effort made to truly understand the topics under discussion. It is self evident to anyone not consumed by a single issue issue obsession that when you say “we” you mean the transit riding populace of all Toronto. In fact, since transit is an integral part of our overall transportation network, you are speaking out in what you believe to be the best interests of all Torontonians.\nKeep up the great work Steve. Your efforts are an important contribution to the debate and to understanding of complex issues. They are welcomed by me as well as thousands of followers anytime.\nSince I asked earlier about LRTs … an interesting development from China: the world’s first “virtual streetcar”.\nBasically it’s a double-articulated bus (though the body looks like a streetcar/bus hybrid, i.e. a modern streetcar body with rubber-tired wheels), that is kept on a fixed route using some form of automatic control (something adapted from automatic train control probably). Instead of rails, sensor along the route and on the vehicle keep it fixed to a “virtual track”. This allows it to be bigger than a bus while requiring less road space and maintaining a streetcar-type top speed (70 km/h is quoted in the video). The fact that it’s route is tightly controlled (and therefore pre-planned) is what I suppose allows it to have the narrower streetcar-like body, since turning radii can be restricted.\nI know the streetcar like long buses have been designed before for use in bus and trolleybus rapid transit systems, what is new here is the automatic control. Maybe it makes this vehicle more “streetcar like” in behaviour than the previous attempts. The advantage is that you get to save on laying the tracks, and in this case, also the distribution network (the example is battery-powered – I wonder how much the batteries cost over its lifetime though).\nObviously this is just the first demo and who knows if this will be viable or rolled out in large quantities. It is though an interesting concept which could make the passenger threshold for LRT-type service drop, since implementing this system should be cheaper than a “proper” LRT line.\nSteve: At this point, I am not going to attempt a technical critique of something that’s only a promo video, but I couldn’t help noticing that the only shot in the “cab” clearly showed the driver with his hands on the steering wheel. I have little doubt that a self-guided bus is possible, and the real question is whether this can actually scale up to a “production” environment. My biggest worry is that, like every technology wonder that comes along, this could prove yet another reason for politicians to delay on commitment to rail-based transit. The opposition to LRT we see in the GTHA is as much a question of the road lanes lost to a dedicated transit corridor as it is the actual technology, but this masquerades as a “streetcars vs subway” debate.\nStreetcars don’t generally derail in snow or slippery conditions. They may not start or stop well, but they will stick to their tracks, and therefore their defined path.\nA rubber-tired automatically-steered bus, in slippery conditions, won’t necessarily follow the guidance instructions. So there is no way you can safely plop it on a narrow right-of-way; at least in Toronto.\nFor a tram bus to work in snow, there would need to be a sprinkler system spraying Glycerol when snow is following. This way, there will be traction for the wheels. Although, the video shows a tram bus using electricity as oppose to diesel. If there are electric motors on each wheel, there will be a lot more traction as traction is available on every wheel. Using a combination of GPS and GLONASS, the tram bus will be accurate to up to 1ft depending on the chipset used. So, even if the line is not visible to the camera for guidance, GPS and GLONASS data can still drive it.\nA 100+ persons capacity vehicle is quite impressive. Until Line 1 is extended to Richmond Hill Center, it can help to remove the parade of YRT buses between Finch and Steeles on Yonge. YRT in its infinite wisdom did not build a rapidway between Richmond Hill Center and Finch. Even if a metro is being build, it will take many years. Terminate all the YRT buses at Richmond Hill Center and use these vehicles on Yonge Street.\nThe Stouffville Line is now a bidirectional all day service. It will be interesting to see how many riders it siphons off Line 2. If fewer people get on Line 2 from the east, there will be less people to change at Bloor-Yonge. Too bad for Mr. Tory, the news release did not mention anything about his Smart Track initiative.\nI hope the TTC will make better connection to those GO stations. For example, the 53E does not stop at Milliken GO station forcing a transfer to a local 53 bus. Likewise, the 190 does not at Agincourt GO either. When Smart Track Finch East and Lawrence East come into reality, express buses will need to stop at those stations too.\nNo one uses glycol to remove snow from the roads. It is slippery and an environmental issue. In any case, if there’s enough snow falling, vehicles will simply have to deal with it. Streetcars have no problems (except at switches which may have to be cleared to confirm settings). Buses can slip and slide, and articulated buses can slide worse of all (granted, current artics are not all-wheel powered). GPS and other guidance won’t do anything for you if you are slipping back down the hill, or off into an embankment. That’s why I consider a “tram-like bus” to be an impossibility in this climate. Sure, you can experiment with self-driving buses, but to imagine that they will always follow their assigned path — like an actual streetcar — to be dreaming.\nActually that crossed my mind as well, but I wanted to start off with a positive spin on things 🙂 although I was impressed by the possibilities of this approach, I almost had an ulterior motive: making sure you hear about it first before some city councilor or future mayor touts something like this as a catch-all solution for all of Toronto’s problems.\nTo be clear, I had no intention of suggesting that LRT lines should be replaced with “virtual streetcars”, only that they might in the future be used to bring LRT-like service to corridors where passenger numbers don’t justify an actual LRT line build-out. IF (and that’s still a huge IF) something like this works, I see it as a way to make BRT more LRT-like in its performance.\n@Ed: I also don’t think there’s a way this would work in a narrow right-of-way the way streetcars in the urban core do, of course.\nJust to note, there have been a handful of “guided bus” transit lines (none with “virtual” guidance though; all through some sort of rail) installed around the world, none of which have been spectacular successes. Bombardier’s recent version of this (GLT) was installed in two cities in France, Nancy and Caen, and Caen decided after a few years to abandon the concept and just convert it to regular streetcars.\nP.S. The use of batteries reminded me of another thing. Last year at a conference I met a gentleman from Bombardier (one of its European offices) who was presenting the power train of the Nanjing tram.\nIt’s a modified Flexity tram that runs on batteries, which are charged at each station. That way they say, 90% of the line is free of the overhead lines. I asked him why Nanjing did this. The answer was aesthetics, they thought it was prettier without the overhead, and novelty value (which seems an important thing in China). He said that in a power-out situation, a fully-charged streetcar would be able to loop around the whole line a couple of times (they did a test running “dry” without recharging at each stop). He said the batteries do not take up any additional space compared to the base Flexity model used, as they are on the roof. Alas, he could not tell me whether batteries vs. overhead lines make sense in terms of cost in the long run. It’s too early to conclude, he said. My feeling is that right now, batteries are not more economical (otherwise they would be touting it) but that they might be in the future.", "question": {"question": " What are the main proposals being considered by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) to improve the city's transit system?", "questionCategory": "summary", "comprehension": "semantic"}, "answer": "\nBased on the text, the main proposals being considered by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) to improve the city's transit system include:\n1.

{"text": "Attached primes of the top local cohomology modules with respect to an ideal (II)\n\nMohammad T. Dibaei and Siamak Yassemi\n\nIntroduction\n\nThroughout $(R, \\mathfrak{m})$ denote a commutative Noetherian local ring and $\\mathfrak{a}$, $\\mathfrak{b}$ are proper ideals of $R$. Assume that $M$ is a finite (i.e. finitely generated) $R$–module of dimension $n$. Recall that for an $R$–module $T$, a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $R$ is said to be an attached prime of $T$ if $\\mathfrak{p}=\\operatorname{Ann}(T/U)$ for some submodule $U$ of $T$. We denote the set of attached primes of $T$ by $\\operatorname{Att}(T)$. This definition agrees with the usual definition of attached primes if $T$ has a secondary representation [M, Theorem 2.5].\n\nIn this paper, we are interested in the structure of ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$, which is the $n$–th right derived functor of $\\Gamma_{\\mathfrak{a}}(M)= \\underset{i>0}\\bigcup 0\\underset{M}: \\mathfrak{a} ^{i}$ on $M$. In [MS] Macdonald and Sharp studied the top local cohomology module with respect to the maximal ideal and showed that ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n}(M)$ is an Artinian module and ${\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n}(M))= \\{\\mathfrak{p}\\in {\\operatorname{Ass}}(M): {\\dim}(R/\\mathfrak{p}) = n\\}$ (the right hand set is denoted by ${\\operatorname{Assh}}(M)$). In [S] Sharp proved that ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n}(M)$ is isomorphic to the last term of the Cousin Complex of $M$, $C_{R}(M)$, with respect to the height filtration of $M$.\nIt is well–known that for any integer $i$ there is an exact sequence $$\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{m}}^{i}(M) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{i}(M)\\longrightarrow \\underset{\\underset{t}\\longrightarrow}\\lim \\operatorname{Ext}_{R}^{i}(\\mathfrak{m}^{t}/\\mathfrak{a}^{t}, M)$$ relating to the local cohomology modules of $M$ with respect to $\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{m}$, cf. [G]. By Hartshorne’s result [H, Page 417], we know that the right hand side module in the above exact sequence is zero. That means there exists an epimorphism $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n}(M) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$ ( in [DS, Theorem 3.2], Divaavi-Aazar and Schenzel calculated the kernel of this epimorphism). In [DY], we investigated the attached primes of ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$, and showed that $${\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))=\\{ \\mathfrak{p}\\in {\\operatorname{Supp}}(M)| \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(R/\\mathfrak{p}) \\neq 0 \\}.$$\n\nThis paper is divided into two sections. In section 1, we continue our investigation of the top local cohomology module $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$. We first show that if $R$ is complete then ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$ is isomorphic to ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n}(K)$ for some homomorphic image $K$ of $M$ (see Theorem 1.3). Then we give a generalization of Hartshorne’s result by showing that if $\\mathfrak{a}\\subseteq \\mathfrak{b}$, then there exists an epimorphism $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$ (see Theorem 1.5).\n\nIt is also shown that, if ${\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))= {\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M))$ then ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\cong {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M)$ (see Proposition 1.7). This result implies that the number of non–isomorphic top local cohomology modules of $M$ is less than or equal to $2^{|\\operatorname{Assh}(M)|}$. We close this section by presenting a reduced secondary representation of $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M)$ (see Theorem 1.10).\n\nIt is not always the case that ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\neq 0$, so the supremum of all integers $i$ for which ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{i}(M)\\neq 0$, denoted by $\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)$, is called the cohomological dimension of $M$ with respect to $\\mathfrak{a}$. It seems that it is not so easy to know the structure of ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M)$. In [H, Proposition 2.3], Hartshorne showed that for an integer $r$, if $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(N)= 0$ for all $R$–modules $N$, then the corresponding condition holds for all $j\\geq r$. In section 2, for a non–negative integer $r$, we generalize Hartshorne’s result by showing that $\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)< r$ if and only if ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(R/\\mathfrak{p}) = 0$ for all $\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ (see Theorem 2.1). Then we specify a subset of $\\operatorname{Att}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd} (\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M))$ by showing that (see Theorem 2.4) $$\\{ \\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Ass}(M) : \\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, R/\\mathfrak{p})= \\dim (R/\\mathfrak{p})= \\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)\\}\\subseteq \\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M)).$$\n\nTop local cohomology modules\n\nIn this section we investigate the top local cohomology module $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$. For a module T over a commutative ring $S$ and $X\\subseteq \\operatorname{Ass}(T)$, there exists a submodule $T'$ of $T$ such that $\\operatorname{Ass}(T')=\\operatorname{Ass}(T)\\setminus X$ and $\\operatorname{Ass}(T/T')= X$ (see [B, p. 263, Proposition 4]). We use this fact frequently throughout the paper without further comment. Recall the following result from [DY, Theorem A].\n\nTheorem\n\nWe have\n$$\\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)) = \\{\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Supp}(M) : \\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, R/\\mathfrak{p})= n \\}.$$\n\nWe first prove the following result which is essential for our approach.\n\nLemma\n\nAssume that $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\neq 0$. Then there exists a homomorphic image $K$ of $M$, such that\n(i) $\\dim (K) = n$,\n(ii) $K$ has no non–zero submodule of dimension less than $n$,\n(iii) ${\\operatorname{Ass}}(K) = \\{\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Ass}(M) : \\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, R/\\mathfrak{p}) = n\\}$,\n(iv) ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(K) \\cong {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$,\n(v) ${\\operatorname{Ass}}(K)={\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(K))$.\nProof. By Theorem 1.1, ${\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))=\\{ \\mathfrak{p}\\in {\\operatorname{Supp}}(M): {\\operatorname{cd}}(\\mathfrak{a}, R/\\mathfrak{p})=n\\}$. Note that if $\\mathfrak{p}\\in {\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))$, then we have $$n={\\operatorname{cd}}(\\mathfrak{a}, R/\\mathfrak{p})\\leq {\\dim}(R/\\mathfrak{p})\\leq {\\dim}(M)=n,$$ and so ${\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))\\subseteq {\\operatorname{Ass}}(M)$. Therefore there is a submodule $N$ of $M$ such that ${\\operatorname{Ass}}(N)={\\operatorname{Ass}}(M)\\setminus {\\operatorname{Att}} ({\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))$ and ${\\operatorname{Ass}}(M/N)= {\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))$. Now, consider the exact sequence ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(N)\\longrightarrow {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\longrightarrow {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M/N)\\longrightarrow 0$. We claim that ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(N)= 0$. In the other case, by Theorem 1.1, there exists $\\mathfrak{p}\\in {\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(N))$ (and hence $\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\operatorname{Ass}(N)$) such that ${\\operatorname{cd}}(\\mathfrak{a}, R/\\mathfrak{p})=n$. Therefore $\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Ass}(M)$ and hence $\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))$, that is a contradiction. Thus ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\cong {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M/N)$. Now the assertions holds for $K:= M/N$. $\\Box$\nNow we are ready to present one of our main results. In the following $\\widehat{L}$ indicates the completion of an $R$-module $L$ with respect to the $\\mathfrak{m}$-adic topology.\n\nTheorem\n\nAssume that ${\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\neq 0$. Then there exists a homomorphic image $K$ of $\\widehat{M}$ with ${\\operatorname{Ass}}_{ \\widehat{R }}(K)={\\operatorname{Att}}_{ \\widehat{R}}({\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))$ and ${\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\cong {\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{m}\\widehat{R}}^{n}(K)$ as $\\widehat{R}$–modules.\nProof. As ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$ is an Artinian $R$–module, it has the structure of $\\widehat{R}$–module and that ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\cong {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a} \\widehat{R}}^{n}(\\widehat{M})$. By applying Lemma 1.2, there exists a finite $\\widehat{R}$–module $K$ which is a homomorphic image of $\\widehat{M}$ such that ${\\operatorname{Ass}} _{\\widehat{R}}(K)={\\operatorname{Att}} _{\\widehat{R}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{{\\mathfrak{a}} \\widehat{R}}^{n}(\\widehat{M}))$ and ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}\\widehat{R}}^{n}(K)\\cong {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a} \\widehat{R}}^{n}(\\widehat{M})$.\nIf $\\mathfrak{q}\\in {\\operatorname{Ass}} _{\\widehat{R}}(K)$, then ${\\operatorname{cd}}(\\mathfrak{a} \\widehat{R}, \\widehat{R}/\\mathfrak{q})=n={\\dim} (\\widehat{R}/\\mathfrak{q})$ and, by Lichtenbaum–Hartshorne Vanishing Theorem of local cohomology, $\\mathfrak{a}\\widehat{R}+\\mathfrak{q}$ is an $\\mathfrak{m}\\widehat{R}$–primary ideal. Therefore, ${\\operatorname{Ann}}_{ \\widehat{R}}(K)+ \\mathfrak{a}\\widehat{R}$ is an $\\mathfrak{m} \\widehat{R}$–primary ideal too. Hence we have $${\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}\\widehat{R}}^{n}(K)\\cong {\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a} \\widehat{R}+ {\\operatorname{Ann}}_{\\widehat{R}}(K)/{\\operatorname{Ann}}_{\\widehat{R}}(K)}^{n}(K)\\cong {\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{m}\\widehat{R}/{\\operatorname{Ann}}_{\\widehat{R}}(K)}^{n}(K).$$ Thus, by using the Independence Theorem of local cohomology (cf. [BS, 4.2.1]), ${\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\cong {\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{m}\\widehat{R}}^{n}(K)$. $\\Box$\nIt is well known that for a ring $R$ with positive dimension if ${\\operatorname{H}}^{\\dim (R)}_\\mathfrak{a}(R)$ is non-zero then it is not finite, cf. [BS, Exercise 8.2.6 (ii)]. As a simple corollary of Theorem 1.3 we give the next result.\n\nCorollary\n\nIf $n>0$ and ${\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\neq 0$, then ${\\operatorname{H}} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$ is not finitely generated $R$–module.\nProof. There exists a finite $\\widehat{R}$-module $K$ such that $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M)\\cong\\operatorname{H}^n_{\\mathfrak{m}\\widehat{R}}(K)$. Now the assertion holds by the fact that $\\operatorname{H}^n_{\\mathfrak{m}\\widehat{R}}(K)$ is not finitely generated. $\\Box$\nAs mentioned in the introduction, by using the results of Grothendieck [G] and Hartshorne [H, page 417], there is an epimorphism $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n}(M) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$. In the following result we generalize it for two ideals $\\mathfrak{a}\\subseteq \\mathfrak{b}$.\n\nTheorem\n\nIf $\\mathfrak{a}\\subseteq \\mathfrak{b}$, then there is an epimorphism $\\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$.\nProof. We may assume that $\\mathfrak{a}\\neq \\mathfrak{b}$ and choose $x\\in \\mathfrak{b}\\setminus \\mathfrak{a}$. By [BS, Proposition 8.1.2], there is an exact sequence $$\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}+xR}^{n}(M)\\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M_{x}),$$ where $M_{x}$ is the localization of $M$ at $\\{x^{i}: i\\geq 0\\}$. Note that $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M_{x})\\cong \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}R_{x}}^{n}(M_{x})$ and $\\dim _{R_{x}}(M_{x})<n$, so that $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}R_{x}}^{n}(M_{x})= 0$. Thus there is an epimorphism $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a} +xR}^{n}(M)\\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$. Now the assertion follows by assuming ${\\mathfrak{b}} = {\\mathfrak{a}} +(x_{1},\\cdots, x_{r})$ and applying the argument for finite steps. $\\Box$\nFor ideals $\\mathfrak{a}\\subseteq\\mathfrak{b}$ it follows from Theorem 1.5 that ${\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)) \\subseteq {\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M))$. In the following result we give another proof (in some sense) of this fact.\n\nProposition\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{b}$ be ideals of $R$ such that $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{b}$. Then ${\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)) \\subseteq {\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M))$. In particular, if ${\\operatorname{H}}_ {\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M) \\neq 0$, then ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M) \\neq 0$.\nProof. We may assume that ${\\operatorname{H}}_ {\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M) \\neq 0$ and $\\mathfrak{p}\\in {\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))$. As mentioned in the introduction, ${\\operatorname{cd}}(\\mathfrak{a}, R/\\mathfrak{p})=n$. Set $S=R/\\operatorname{Ann}M$. By [DY, Theorem A and Corollary 4], there is $\\mathfrak{q}\\in {\\operatorname{Assh}} (\\widehat{S})$ such that $\\mathfrak{p}=\\mathfrak{q}\\cap R$ and ${\\dim}(\\widehat{S}/ \\mathfrak{a}\\widehat{S} +\\mathfrak{q}) =0$. This implies that ${\\dim}(\\widehat{S}/\\mathfrak{b}\\widehat{S} +\\mathfrak{q}) =0$. Again, by [DY, Corollary 4 and Theorem A], $\\mathfrak{p}\\in {\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M))$.$\\Box$\nIn the following result it is shown that if $R$ is complete, then the existence of an epimorphism $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{b}(M)\\to\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M)$ still valid under weaker condition. More precisely:\n\nTheorem\n\nAssume that $R$ is complete and that $\\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M))\\subseteq\\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{b}(M))$. Then there exists an epimorphism $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{b}(M)\\to\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M)$.\nProof. Choose a submodule $N$ of $M$ with $\\operatorname{Ass}(N)=\\operatorname{Ass} (M)\\setminus\\operatorname{Att}\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{b}(M)$ and $\\operatorname{Ass} (M/N)=\\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{b}(M))$. As in the proof of Lemma 1.2, $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{b}(N)=0$. Hence we have an isomorphism $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{b}(M)\\cong\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{b}(M/N)$. Note that any element $\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\operatorname{Ass}(M/N)$ satisfies $\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{b}, R/\\mathfrak{p})=n$, so that, by Lichtenbaum–Hartshorne Vanishing Theorem, $\\mathfrak{b}+\\mathfrak{p}$ is $\\mathfrak{m}$-primary. This shows that $\\mathfrak{b}+\\operatorname{Ann}(M/N)$ is an $\\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal and thus $$\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{b}(M/N)\\cong\\operatorname{H}^n_{\\mathfrak{b}+\\operatorname{Ann}(M/N)}(M/N)\\cong\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{m}(M/N).$$ On the other hand, in the exact sequence $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(N)\\to\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M)\\to\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M/N)\\to 0$, if $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(N)\\neq 0$, then there exists $\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(N))$. Thus, by Theorem 1.1, $\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\operatorname{Ass}(N)$ and $\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, R/\\mathfrak{p})=n$. As $\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\operatorname{Ass}(M)$, by Theorem 1.1, $\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M))$, which contradicts with $\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\operatorname{Ass} (N)$. Therefore $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(N)=0$, and hence $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M)\\cong\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M/N)$. Finally, as $\\mathfrak{a}\\subseteq\\mathfrak{m}$, by Theorem 1.5, there exists an epimorphism $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{m}(M/N)\\to\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M/N)$, and the proof is complete.$\\Box$\nIn [C. Corollary 1.7], Call shows that the set { $\\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\dim (R)}(R): \\mathfrak{a}\\subseteq R \\}$ has (up to isomorphism) only finitely many modules. In the following result we give a generalization of Call’s result.\n\nProposition\n\nIf ${\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))= {\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M))$, then ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\cong {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M)$. In addition the number of non–isomorphic top local cohomology modules ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$ is not greater than $2^{|\\operatorname{Assh}(M)|}-1$.\nProof. Since ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$ and ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M)$ have the structures of $\\widehat{R}$–modules, we may assume that $R$ is complete. We take $N$ to be a submodule of $M$ such that ${\\operatorname{Ass}}(M/N) ={\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))$, ${\\operatorname{Ass}}(N) = {\\operatorname{Ass}}(M)\\setminus {\\operatorname{Att}}({\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M))$, and consider the exact sequences $${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(N)\\longrightarrow {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\longrightarrow {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M/N)\\longrightarrow 0,$$ $${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(N)\\longrightarrow {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M)\\longrightarrow {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M/N)\\longrightarrow 0.$$\n\nSo, as in the proof of Theorem 1.3, we have ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)\\cong {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n}(M/N)\\cong {\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{b}}^{n}(M)$. $\\Box$\nThe following result is now clear for finite module $M$ with $|\\operatorname{Assh}(M)|=1$.\n\nCorollary\n\nAssume that ${\\operatorname{Assh}}(M)$ is a singleton set. For any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ if $\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)=n$, then the non–zero local cohomology module ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$ is isomorphic to ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n}(M)$.\nProof. The assertion follows from the facts that ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n}(M) \\neq 0$ and the number of non-isomorphic top local cohomology modules ${\\operatorname{H}}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{n}(M)$ is not greater than 1. $\\Box$\nNow we are ready to present a reduced secondary representation of the top local cohomology modules of $M$ with respect to an ideal. Let $\\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M))=\\{\\mathfrak{p}_1,\\mathfrak{p}_2,\\cdots,\\mathfrak{p}_r\\}$. For each $1\\le i\\le r$, there exists a submodule $L_i$ of $M$ such that $\\operatorname{Ass}(L_i)=\\{\\mathfrak{p}_i\\}$ and $\\operatorname{Ass}(M/L_i)=\\operatorname{Ass}(M)\\backslash\\{\\mathfrak{p}_i\\}$. Consider the following exact sequences $$\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(L_i)\\stackrel{\\varphi_i}{\\to}\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M)\\to\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M/L_i)\\to 0.$$ Note that $\\varphi_i(\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(L_i))\\neq 0$, otherwise $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M)\\cong\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M/L_i)$ but $\\mathfrak{p}_i$ does not belong to $\\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M/L_i))$.\n\nTheorem\n\nWith the above notations the following is a reduced secondary representation of $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M)$, $$\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(M)=\\sum_{i=1}^r\\varphi_i(\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(L_i)).$$\nProof. Let $1\\le i\\le r$ and $\\bar{}:R\\to R/\\operatorname{Ann}M$ be the natural map. Since $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(L_i)\\cong\\operatorname{H}^n_{\\mathfrak{a}\\bar{R}}(L_i)$, $\\operatorname{Att}_{\\bar{R}}(\\operatorname{H}^n_{\\mathfrak{a}\\bar{R}}(L_i))=\\{\\bar{\\mathfrak{p}_i}\\}$ and $\\bar{\\mathfrak{p}_i}$ is minimal in $\\operatorname{Spec}\\bar{R}$ we have that $\\operatorname{H}^n_{\\mathfrak{a}\\bar{R}}(L_i)$ is a secondary $\\bar{R}$-module, cf. [R, Lemma 2]. Thus $\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(L_i)$ is a secondary $R$-module too. Therefore $\\varphi_i(\\operatorname{H}^n_\\mathfrak{a}(L_i))$ is also a $\\mathfrak{p}_i$-secondary $R$-module. Now by using the argument as in the proof of [DY, Theorem B] the assertion holds.$\\Box$\n\nLast non–zero local cohomology modules\n\nThis section is devoted to study the last non–zero local cohomology modules $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M)$. We first prove that $\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)$ is equal to the infimum of integers $i\\geq 0$ such that $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{i+1}(R/\\mathfrak{p})$ is zero for all $\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Supp} (M)$ (see Theorem 2.1). We do not know much about the module $\\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M)$, and the only information that we could find is to specify a certain subset of the set of its attached primes (see Theorem 2.2).\n\nIn [H, Proposition 2.3], Hartshorne showed that for an integer $r$, if $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(N)= 0$ for all $R$–modules $N$, then the corresponding condition holds for all $j\\geq r$. In the following Theorem we give a result related to the Hartshorne’s one.\n\nTheorem\n\nLet $r\\geq 0$ be a given integer such that $\\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(R/\\mathfrak{p})=0$ for all $\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Supp} (M)$. Then\n(a) $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(N)= 0$ for all finite $R$–modules $N$ with $\\operatorname{Supp}(N) \\subseteq \\operatorname{Supp}(M)$. In particular $\\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(M)= 0$.\n(b) $\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, R/\\mathfrak{p})< r$ for all $\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Supp}(M)$. In particular $\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)< r$.\nProof. (a). It is enough to show that $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(M)= 0$. There is a prime filtration $0= M_{0}\\subseteq M_{1}\\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq M_{s}= M$ of submodules of $M$ such that, for each $1\\leq j\\leq s$, $M_{j}/M_{j-1}\\cong R/\\mathfrak{p}_{j}$, where $\\mathfrak{p} _{j}\\in \\operatorname{Supp}(M)$. From the exact sequences $$\\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(M_{j-1})\\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(M_{j})\\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(R/\\mathfrak{p}_{j})$$ we eventually get $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(M)= 0$.\n(b). By (a), $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(R/\\mathfrak{b})= 0$ for all ideals $\\mathfrak{b}$ of $R$ with $V(\\mathfrak{b})\\subseteq \\operatorname{Supp}(M)$. We first show that $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r+1}(R/\\mathfrak{p})= 0$ for all $\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Supp}(M)$. Assume that $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r+1}(R/\\mathfrak{p})\\neq 0$ for some $\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Supp}(M)$, so that $\\mathfrak{a}\\nsubseteq \\mathfrak{p}$. Choose $0\\neq w\\in \\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r+1}(R/\\mathfrak{p})$. Since $w$ is annihilated by some power of $\\mathfrak{a}$, there exists $x\\in \\mathfrak{a}\\setminus \\mathfrak{p}$ such that $xw= 0$. Now consider the exact sequence $0\\longrightarrow R/\\mathfrak{p}\\overset{x}\\longrightarrow R/\\mathfrak{p}\\longrightarrow R/(\\mathfrak{p}+xR)\\longrightarrow 0$ which induces the exact sequence $$\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(R/(\\mathfrak{p}+xR))\\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r+1}(R/\\mathfrak{p})\\overset{x}\\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r+1}(R/\\mathfrak{p}).$$ As $V(\\mathfrak{p}+ xR)\\subseteq \\operatorname{Supp}(M)$, by (a), $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(R/(\\mathfrak{p}+xR))= 0$. Thus the map $\\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r+1}(R/\\mathfrak{p})\\overset{x}\\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r+1}(R/\\mathfrak{p})$ is injective. As $xw= 0$, we get $w= 0$ which is a contradiction. Therefore $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r+1}(R/\\mathfrak{p})= 0$ for all $\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Supp}(M)$. By (a), $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r+1}(N)= 0$ for all finite $R$–modules $N$ with $\\operatorname{Supp}(N) \\subseteq \\operatorname{Supp}(M)$. We proceed by induction and the proof is complete. $\\Box$\n\nCorollary\n\nFor a finite $R$-module $M$, we have:\n\n$\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)= \\inf \\{r\\geq 0 : \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(R/\\mathfrak{p})= 0$ for all $\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Supp}(M) \\}-1$.\n\n$\\Box$\n\nCorollary\n\nFor each integer $i$ with $0\\leq i\\leq \\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)$, there exists $\\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ with $\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{i}(R/\\mathfrak{p})\\neq 0$. $\\Box$\nOur final result specifies a certain subset of $\\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H} _{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M))$.\n\nTheorem\n\nThe set $T:= \\{ \\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Ass}(M) : \\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, R/\\mathfrak{p})= \\dim (R/\\mathfrak{p})= \\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)\\}$ is a subset of $\\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M))$. In particular, we have equality if $\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)=\\dim (M)$.\nProof. Assume that the set $S:=\\{ \\mathfrak{p}\\in \\operatorname{Ass}(M) : \\dim (R/\\mathfrak{p})= \\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)\\}$ is not empty. There exists a submodule $N$ of $M$ with $\\operatorname{Ass}(N)= \\operatorname{Ass}(M)\\setminus S$ and $\\operatorname{Ass}(M/N)= S$. As $\\operatorname{Supp} (N)\\subseteq\\operatorname{Supp}(M)$, we have the exact sequence\n$$\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(N)\\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M)\\longrightarrow \\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M/N)\\longrightarrow 0$$ (see [DNT, Theorem 2.2]). This shows that $\\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M/N))\\subseteq \\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M))$. Therefore it is sufficient to show that $T= \\operatorname{Att}(\\operatorname{H}_{\\mathfrak{a}}^{\\operatorname{cd}(\\mathfrak{a}, M)}(M/N))$.

initial capital letters, the following words and phrases will have the meanings set forth below unless the context indicates \nthat other meanings are intended. \nACTUAL DEFERRAL PERCENTAGE (ADP) \nMeans, for a specified group of Participants (either Highly Compensated Employees or non-Highly Compensated Employees) for a Plan Year, the \naverage of the ratios (calculated separately for each Participant in such group) of 1) the amount of Employer Contributions actually paid to the Fund \non behalf of such Participant for the Plan Year to 2) the Part\nating the ADP, Employer \nContributions on behalf of any Participant will include: 1) any Elective Deferrals (other than Catch-up Contributions) made pursuant to the \nElective Deferral enrollment, if applicable (including Excess Elective Deferrals of Highly \nCompensated Employees), but excluding Excess Elective Deferrals of Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees that arise solely from \nElective Deferrals made under the Plan or plans of this Employer. For purposes of computing Actual Deferral Percentages, an Employee who would \nbe a Participant but for the failure to make Elective Deferrals will be treated as a Participant on whose behalf no Elective Deferrals are made. \nADOPTING EMPLOYER  \nMeans any corporation, sole proprietor, or other entity named in the Adoption Agreement and any successor who by merger, consolidation, purchase, or \notherwise assumes the obligations of the Plan. The Adopting Employer will be a named fiduciary for purposes of ERISA section 402(a). \nADOPTION AGREEMENT  \nMeans the document executed by the Adopting Employer through which it adopts the Plan and thereby agrees to be bound by all terms and \nconditions of the Plan.  \nALTERNATE PAYEE \nMeans any Spouse, former Spouse, child, or other dependent of a Participant who is recognized by a Domestic Relations Order as having a right to \nreceive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under the Plan with respect to such Participant. \nANNUAL ADDITIONS \nMeans the sum of the following amounts credited to a Participant for the Limitation Year: \na.\nEmployer Contributions;\nb.\nnondeductible employee contributions;\nc.\namounts allocated to an individual medical account, as defined in Code section 415(l)(2), that is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by\nthe Employer, and amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued that are attributable to post-retirement medical benefits, allocated to\nthe separate account of a key employee (as defined in Code section 419A(d)(3)), under a welfare benefit fund (as defined in Code section\n419(e)), maintained by the Employer;\nd.\namounts allocated under a simplified employee pension plan; and\ne.\nExcess Contributions (including amounts recharacterized).\nANNUITY STARTING DATE \nMeans the first day of the first period for which an amount is paid as an annuity or in any other form. \nBASIC PLAN DOCUMENT \nMeans this Pre-approved Defined Contribution Basic Plan Document 02. \nBENEFICIARY \nMeans the individual(s) or entity(ies) designated pursuant to Plan Section Five. \nBREAK IN ELIGIBILITY SERVICE \nMeans a 12-consecutive month period that coincides with an Eligibility Computation Period during which an Employee fails to complete more than \n500 Hours of Service.  \nCATCH-UP CONTRIBUTIONS \nMeans Elective Deferrals made pursuant to Plan Section Three that are in excess of an otherwise applicable Plan limit and that are made by \nParticipants who are age 50 or older by the end of their taxable year. An otherwise applicable Plan limit is a limit in the Plan that applies to Elective \nDeferrals without regard to Catch-up Contributions, such as the limits on Annual Additions, the dollar limitation on Elective Deferrals under Code \nsection 402(g) (not counting Catch-up Contributions), the limit imposed by the Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) test under Code section 401(k)(3), \nor any other allowable limit imposed by the Employer. Catch-up Contributions for a Participant for a taxable year may not exceed (1) the dollar limit \non Catch-up Contributions under Code section 414(v)(2)(B)(i) for the taxable year or (2) when added to other Elective Deferrals, an amount that \nwould enable the Employer to satisfy other statutory or regulatory requirements (e.g., income tax withholding, FICA and FUTA withholding). The \ndollar limit on Catch-up Contributions in Code section 414(v)(2)(B)(i) was $5,500 for taxable years beginning in 2012. The $5,500 limit is adjusted by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in multiples of $500, for cost-of-living increases under Code section 414(v)(2)(C).  \nPage 2 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \nCODE \nMeans the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended from time to time. \nCOMPENSATION \nThe following definition of Compensation will apply. \nW-2 wages. Compensation is defined as information required to be reported under Code sections 6041, 6051, and 6052 (wages, tips, and other\ncompensation as reported on Form W-2). Compensation is further defined as wages within the meaning of Code section 3401(a) and all other\npayments of compensation to an Employee by the Employer (in the \nyer is\nrequired to furnish the Employee a written statement under Code sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3), and 6052. Compensation must be determined\nwithout regard to any rules in Code section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the\nemployment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code section 3401(a)(2)).\nFor any Self-Employed Individual covered under the Plan, Compensation will mean Earned Income. \n Where an Employee becomes an eligible Participant on any date subsequent to the first day of the \napplicable Determination Period, Compensation shall include that Compensation paid to the Employee during the entire Determination Period, \nunless otherwise required by either the Code or ERISA. Compensation received by an Employee during a Determination Period in which the \nEmployee does not perform services for the Employer will be disregarded. \nCompensation will include any amount that is contributed by the Employer pursuant to a salary reduction agreement and that is not includible \nin the gross income of the Employee under Code sections 125, 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), or 403(b).  \nFor purposes of applying the limitations of Plan Section 3.05, Compensation for a Limitation Year is the Compensation actually paid or made available \nin gross income during such Limitation Year. Compensation paid or made available during such Limitation Year will include any elective deferral (as \ndefined in Code section 402(g)(3)) and any amount that is contributed or deferred by the Employer at the election of the Employee and that is not \nincludible in the gross income of the Employee by reason of Code sections 125, 132(f), or 457.  \nPayments made after Severance from Employment will be included in Compensation within the meaning of Compensation as described in Part \nA of the definition of Compensation in\nthey meet the following requirements: \n1.\nPayments described in paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) below will be included in the definition of Compensation (within the meaning of\nCompensation as described in Part A of this definition of Compensation) provided such payments meet the following requirements:\na.\nThose amounts are paid by the later of 1) 2½ months after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan or 2)\nthe end of the Limitation Year that includes the date of Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan; and\nb.\nThose amounts would have been included in the definition of Co\nrom \nEmployment with the Employer maintaining the Plan.\n2.\nRegular Pay. An amount is described in this paragraph (2) if\na.\nThe payment is regular compensation for services during the\nutside \n and \nb.\nThe payment would have been paid to the Employee prior to a Severance from Employment if the Employee had continued in\nemployment with the Employer.\n3.\nLeave Cashouts. An amount is described in this paragraph (3) if\na.\nThe payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation, or other leave, but only if the Employee would have been able to use the\nleave if employment had continued.\n4.\nDeferred Compensation. An amount is described in this paragraph (4) if\na.\nThe payment is an amount received by an Employee pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the\npayment would have been paid to the Employee at the same time if the Employee had continued in employment with the Employer\nand only to the extent that the payment is\n5.\nOther post-severance payments. Any payment that is not described in paragraph (2), (3), or (4) above is not considered Compensation under\nparagraph (1) above if paid after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan, even if it is paid within the time period\ndescribed in paragraph (1) above. Thus, Compensation does not include severance pay, or parachute payments within the meaning of Code\nsection 280G(b)(2), if they are paid after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan, and does not include post-\nseverance payments under a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan unless the payments would have been paid at that time\nwithout regard to the Severance from Employment. Any payments not described above are not considered Compensation if paid after \nSeverance from Employment, even if they are paid within 2½ months following Severance from Employment.\nCompensation for purposes of ADP and Code section 401(a)(4) testing will \ngenerally be W-2 wages unless another definition is required by law or regulation. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Plan Administrator has the \noption from year to year to use a different definition of Compensation for testing purposes provided the definition of Compensation satisfies Code \nsection 414(s) and the corresponding regulations.  \nPage 3 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \nThe annual Compensation of each Participant taken into account in determining allocations will not exceed \n$200,000, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code section 401(a)(17)(B). Annual Compensation means Compensation \nduring the Plan Year or such other consecutive 12-month period over which Compensation is otherwise determined under the Plan \n(Determination Period).

The Employer may, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, allow only Employees who have become Participants in \nthe Plan to make rollover contributions. However, if the Employer permits Employees who have not become Participants in the Plan and/or \nformer Employees to maintain rollover contributions in the Plan, such individuals will be treated as Participants for purposes of those assets, \nbut they may not receive a loan from the Fund. \n3.04 \nTRANSFER CONTRIBUTIONS \nThe Adopting Employer may, subject to uniform and nondiscriminatory rules, permit elective transfers to be delivered to the Trustee (or \nCustodian, if applicable) in the name of an Employee from the trustee or custodian of another plan qualified under Code section 401(a). \nWhether any particular elective transfer will be accepted by the Plan will be determined using the uniform and nondiscriminatory rules \nestablished by the Plan Administrator, and the procedures for the receipt of such transfers by the Plan must be allowed under Code section \n411(d)(6), Treasury Regulation section 1.411(d)-4, and other rules promulgated by the IRS. Nothing in this Plan prohibits the Plan Administrator \nfrom permitting (or prohibiting) Participants to transfer their Individual Accounts to other eligible plans, provided such transfers are permitted \n(or prohibited) in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. If it is later determined that all or part of an elective transfer was ineligible to be \ntransferred into the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any ineligible amounts, plus earnings or losses attributable thereto \n(determined in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)), be distributed from the Plan to the Employee as soon as administratively \nfeasible. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may, at its discretion, also return the amount transferred to the transferor plan or \ncorrect the ineligible transfer using any other method permitted by the IRS under regulation or other guidance. \nA separate account will be maintained by the Plan Administrato\nle, be \nnonforfeitable at all times. Such account will share in the income and gains and losses of the Fund in the manner described in Plan Section \n7.02(B). If elective transfers are associated with distributable events and the Employees are eligible to receive single sum distributions \nconsisting entirely of Eligible Rollover Contributions, the elective transfers will be considered Direct Rollovers. \n3.05 \nINTENTIONALLY OMITTED \nPage 16 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \n3.06 \nLIMITATION ON ALLOCATIONS \nA.\nIf the Participant does not participate in, and has never participated in, another qualified plan maintained by the Employer, a welfare\nbenefit fund (as defined in Code section 419(e)) maintained by the Employer, an individual medical account (as defined in Code\nsection 415(l)(2)) maintained by the Employer, or a simplified employee pension plan (as defined in Code section 408(k)) maintained\nby the Employer, any of which provides an Annual Addition as defined in the Definitions section of the Plan, the following rules will\napply.\n1.\nThe amount of Annual Additions that may be credited to the\nexceed the lesser of the Maximum Permissible Amount or any other limitation contained in this Plan.

A Participant is a Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if they meet the definition of a Highly Compensated\nEmployee in effect for that Plan Year. Similarly, a Participant is a non-Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if\nthey do not meet the definition of a Highly Compensated Employee in effect for that Plan Year.\n2. The ADP for any Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee for the Plan Year and who is eligible to have Elective\nDeferrals allocated to their Individual Accounts under two or more arrangements described in Code section 401(k) that are\nmaintained by the Employer, will be determined as if such Elective Deferrals were made under a single arrangement. If a Highly\nCompensated Employee participates in two or more cash or deferred arrangements that have different Plan Years, all Elective\nDeferrals made during the Plan Year under all such arrangements will be aggregated. Certain plans will be treated as separate if\nmandatorily disaggregated under the Treasury Regulations under Code section 401(k).\n3. In the event that this Plan satisfies the requirements of Code sections 401(k), 401(a)(4), or 410(b) only if aggregated with one or\nmore other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the requirements of such Code sections only if aggregated with this Plan,\nthen this Plan Section 3.07(B)(3) will be applied by determining the ADP of Participants as if all such plans were a single plan. If\nted Employees are involved in a plan coverage change as\ndefined in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-2(c)(4), then any adjustments to the non-Highly Compensated Employee ADP for\nthe prior year will be made in accordance with such regulations. Plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy Code section 401(k)\nonly if they have the same Plan Year and use the same ADP testing method.\n4. For purposes of satisfying the ADP test, Elective Deferrals must be made before the end of the 12-month period immediately\nfollowing the Plan Year to which contributions relate.\n5. The Employer shall maintain records sufficient to demonstrate satisfaction of the ADP test.\n6. The determination and treatment of the ADP amounts of any Participant will satisfy such other requirements as may be\nprescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n7. In the event that the Plan Administrator determines that it is not likely that the ADP test will be satisfied for a particular Plan Year\nunless certain steps are taken before the end of such Plan Year, the Plan Administrator may require Contributing Participants\nwho are Highly Compensated Employees to reduce or cease future Elective Deferrals for such Plan Year in order to satisfy that\nrequirement. This limitation will be considered a Plan-imposed limit for Catch-up Contribution purposes. If the Plan\nAdministrator requires Contributing Participants to reduce or cease making Elective Deferrals under this paragraph, the\nreduction or cessation will begin with the Highly Compensated Employee with either the largest amount of Elective Deferrals or\nthe highest Contribution Percentage for the Plan Year (on the date on which it is determined that the ADP test will not likely be\nsatisfied), as elected by the Plan Administrator. All remainin\nective Deferrals for the Plan\nYear will be limited to such amount. Notwithstanding the preceding, if it is later determined that the ADP test for the Plan Year\nwill be satisfied, Highly Compensated Employees will be permitted to enroll again as Contributing Participants in accordance\nwith the terms of the Plan.\n8. Elective Deferrals that are treated as Catch-up Contributions because they exceed a Plan limit or a statutory limit will be\nexcluded from ADP testing. Amounts which are characterized as Ca\n of the ADP test will reduce \nthe amount of Excess Contributions distributed. \nSECTION FOUR: VESTING AND FORFEITURES \nAn Employee is 100 percent vested in their Individual Account which shall be nonforfeitable at all times. \nPage 18 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \nSECTION FIVE: DISTRIBUTIONS TO PARTICIPANTS \n5.01 \nDISTRIBUTIONS \nA.\nEligibility for Distributions\nTermination of Employment, attainment of Normal Retirement Age, Disability, attainment of age 59½, or the termination of the \nPlan.

The operational procedures may include \nan option for Participants to designate whether the distribution is being made from Pre-Tax or Roth Elective Deferrals. \ntribution \nmust submit a request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan\nAdministrator. If required in writing, such request will be made upon a form provided or approved by the Plan Administrator. Upon \na valid request, the Plan Administrator will direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to commence distribution as soon as \nadministratively feasible after the request is received. \nDistributions will be made based on the value of the Individual Account available at the time of actual distribution. To the extent \nthe distribution request is for an amount greater than the Individual Account, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be \nentitled to distribute the entire Individual Account. \nB.\nDistributions Upon Termination of Employment\n1.\nIndividual Account Balances Less Than or Equal to Cashout Level\nigible \nRollover Distribution, distribution from the Plan may be made to the Participant in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of \nvidual Account does not exceed $1,000 and qualifies as an Eligible \nRollover Distribution, and the Participant does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan \nspecified by the Participant in a Direct Rollover or to receive the distribution in accordance with this Section Five of the Plan, \ndistribution will be made to the Participant in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribution under the Plan.

Participants who claim \nExcess Elective Deferrals for the preceding calendar year must submit their claims (either in writing or in any other form permitted \nunder rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator by March 1. A Participant is deemed to notify the Plan \nAdministrator of any Excess Elective Deferrals that arise by taking into account only those Elective Deferrals made to this Plan and any \nother plan, contract, or arrangement of the Employer. \nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, Excess Elective Deferrals, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto, will \nbe distributed no later than April 15th to any Participant to whose Individual Account Excess Elective Deferrals were assigned for the \npreceding year and who claims Excess Elective Deferrals for such taxable year, except to the extent such Excess Elective Deferrals were \nclassified as Catch-up Contributions. The Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, will determine whether the \nt or the \nRoth Elective Deferral account, or a combination of both, to the extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals \nwere made for the year, or may allow Participants to specify otherwise. \nExcess Elective Deferrals will be adjusted for any income or loss up to the end of the Plan Year to \nwhich such contributions were allocated. The income or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals is the income or loss allocable to the \niplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is such Participa\nective \nDeferrals without regard to any income or loss occurring during such taxable year. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Plan Administrator \nmay compute the income or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B) (i.e., the usual \nmanner used by the Plan for allocating income or loss to Partic\nsuch \nmethod is used consistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year. The Plan will not fail to \nuse a reasonable method for computing the income or loss on Excess Elective Deferrals merely because the income allocable is based on \na date that is no more than seven days before the distribution. \nPage 28 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \n5.13 \nDISTRIBUTION OF EXCESS CONTRIBUTIONS \nA. \n Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, Excess Contributions, plus any income and minus any loss allocable \nthereto, will be distributed no later than 12 months after a Plan Year to Participants to whose Individual Accounts such Excess \nContributions were allocated for such Plan Year, except to the extent such Excess Contributions were classified as Catch-up \nContributions. Excess Contributions are allocated to the Highly Compensated Employees with the largest amounts of Employer \nContributions taken into account in calculating the ADP test for the year in which the excess arose, beginning with the Highly \nCompensated Employee with the largest amount of such Employer Contributions and continuing in descending order until all the \nExcess Contributions have been allocated. Both the total amount of the Excess Contribution and, for purposes of the preceding \nEmployee has not reached their Catch-up Contribution limit under the Plan, Excess Contributions allocated to such Highly \nCompensated Employees as Catch-up Contributions will not be treated as Excess Contributions. If such Excess Contributions are \ndistributed more than 2½ months after the last day of the Plan Year in which such Contributions were made, a ten-percent excise tax \nwill be imposed on the Employer maintaining the Plan with respect to such amounts. Excess Contributions will be treated as annual \nadditions under the Plan even if distributed. \nExcess Contributions will be adjusted for any income or loss up to the end of the Plan Year to \nwhich such contributions were allocated. The income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions allocated to each Participant is the \nrator of \nunt \nbalance attributable to Elective Deferrals without regard to any income or loss occurring during such Plan Year. Notwithstanding the \npreceding, the Plan Administrator may compute the income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions in the manner described in Plan \nany \nreasonable method), provided such method is used consistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan \nfor the Plan Year. The Plan will not fail to use a reasonable method for computing the income or loss on Excess Contributions merely \nbecause the income allocable is based on a date that is no more than seven days before the distribution. \nC.\nAccounting for Ex\nn a uniform \nand nondiscriminatory manner, will either determine whether the distribution of Excess Contributions for a year will be made first \nferral account or the Roth Elective Deferral account, or a combination of both, to the extent \nboth Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the year, or may allow Participants to specify otherwise. \nSECTION SIX: DEFINITIONS \nWords and phrases used in the Plan with initial capital letters will, for the purpose of this Plan, have the meanings set forth in the portion of the Plan \nSECTION SEVEN: MISCELLANEOUS \n7.01 \nTHE FUND \n By adopting this Plan, the Employer establishes the Fund, which will consist of the assets of the \nPlan held by the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable).

To the extent that assets are earmarked for a \nparticular Participant, they will be held in a Separate Fund for that Participant.  \nNo part of the corpus or income of the Fund may be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of \nParticipants or their Beneficiaries. The Fund will be valued each Valuation Date at fair market value.  \n The Employer may direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to divide and redivide \nthe Fund into one or more Investment Funds. Such Investment Funds may include, but are not limited to, Investment Funds \nrepresenting the assets under the control of an investment manager pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(C) and Investment Funds \nrepresenting investment options available for individual direction by Participants pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(B). Upon each division \nor redivision, the Employer may specify the part of the Fund to be allocated to each such Investment Fund and the terms and \nconditions, if any, under which the assets in such Investment Fund will be invested. \n7.02 \nINDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS \n The Plan Administrator shall establish and maintain an Individual Account in the name of each \nParticipant to reflect the total value of their interest in the Fund (including but not limited to Employer Contributions and earnings \nthereon).

Each such portion is reduced by any withdrawal made from the applicable Investment Fund to or for\nsince the previous Valuation Date, and is increased by any amount transferred from another Investment Fund since the\nprevious Valuation Date. The resulting amounts are the net Individual Account portions invested in the Investment Funds.\nb.\nNo Separate Fund\ndownwards, pro rata (i.e., using the ratio of each net Individual Account portion to the sum of all net Individual Account\nportions) so that the sum of all the net Individual Account portions invested in an Investment Fund will equal the then fair\nmarket value of the Investment Fund.

However,\nit will be understood that the Pre-approved Document Provider will be under no obligation to amend the Plan documents, and\nthe Employer expressly waives any rights or claims against the Pre-approved Document Provider for not exercising this power to\namend. For purposes of Pre-approved Document Provider amendments, the mass submitter will generally be recognized as the\nagent of the Pre-approved Document Provider. If the Pre-approved Document Provider does not adopt IRS model amendments\nadopted by the mass submitter, the Plan will no longer be identical to or a minor modifier of the mass submitter plan and will be\nconsidered an individually designed plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, the adoption of good faith IRS amendments must be\naccomplished pursuant to the rules for each such amendment as prescribed by the IRS.\nHowever, for purposes of reliance on an opinion letter, the Pre-approved Document Provider will no longer have the authority to\namend the Plan on behalf of the Employer as of the date the Employer amends the Plan to incorporate a type of plan that is not\npermitted under the Revenue Procedure 2017-41 Pre-approved program, or as of the date the IRS notifies the Employer that the\nPlan is an individually designed plan due to the nature and extent of\n2.\nAn amendment by the Pre-approved Document Provider will be accomplished by giving notice (either in writing or in any other\nform permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Adopting Employer of the amendment to be made. The\nnotice will set forth the text of such amendment and the date such amendment is to be effective. Such amendment will take\neffect unless within the 30-day period after such notice is provided, or within such shorter period as the notice may specify, the\nAdopting Employer gives the Pre-approved Document Provider written notice of refusal to consent to the amendment. Such\nwritten notice of refusal will have the effect of withdrawing the Plan as a pre-approved plan and will cause the Plan to be\nconsidered an individually designed plan.\nPage 31 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \n3.\nIn addition to the amendment rights described above, the Pre-approved Document Provider will have the right to terminate its\nsponsorship of this Plan by providing notice (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS\nand DOL) to the Adopting Employer of such termination. Such termination of sponsorship will have the effect of withdrawing the\nPlan as a pre-approved plan and will cause the Plan to be considered an individually designed plan. The Pre-approved\nDocument Provider will have the right to terminate its sponsorship of this Plan regardless of whether the Pre-approved\nDocument Provider has terminated sponsorship with respect to other employers adopting its pre-approved Plan.\nThe Adopting Employer may amend the Plan to \n1.\nchange options previously selected in the Adoption Agreement;\n2.\nadd overriding language in the Adoption Agreement when such language is necessary to satisfy Code section 415 or Code\nsection 416 because of the required aggregation of multiple plans;\n3.\namend administrative provisions of the Plan such as provisions relating to investments, claims procedures, and Employer contact\ninformation provided the amended provisions are not in conflict with any other provision of the Plan and do not cause the Plan\nto fail to qualify under section 401;\n4.\nadd certain sample and model amendments published by the IRS or other required good faith amendments, that specifically\nprovide that their adoption will not cause the Plan to be treated as individually designed;\n5.\nadd or change provisions permitted under the Plan or specify or change the Effective Date of a provision as permitted under the\nPlan;\n6.\namend to adjust for limitations provided under sections 415, 402(g), 401(a)(17) and 414(q)(1)(B) to reflect annual cost- of-living\nincreases, other than to add automatic cost-of-living adjustments to the Plan; and\n7.\nmake amendments that are related to a change in qualification requirements.\nAn Adopting Employer who wishes to amend the Plan shall document the amendment in writing, executed by a duly authorized \nofficer of the Adopting Employer. If the amendment is in the form of a restated Adoption Agreement, the amendment will become \neffective on the date provided in the Adoption Agreement. Any other amendment will become effective as described therein upon \nexecution by the Adopting Employer and, if appropriate, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). A copy of a restated Adoption \nAgreement or other amendment must be provided to the Pre-approved Document Provider and the Trustee (or Custodian, if \napplicable) before the effective date of the amendment. \nThe Adopting Employer further reserves the right to replace the Plan in its entirety by adopting another retirement plan which the \nAdopting Employer designates as a replacement plan. \nNo amendment to the Plan will be effective to the extent that it has the effect of decreasing a \nextent permitted under Code section 412(d)(2) or to the extent permitted under Treasury Regulations sections 1.411(d)-3 and \n1.411(d)-4. For purposes of this paragraph, a Plan amendment that has the effect of decreasing a Participan\nnt with \nrespect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment will be treated as reducing an accrued benefit. For purposes of this \nparagraph, a Participant will not accrue a right to an allocation of an Employer Profit Sharing Contribution for the current Plan Year \nuntil the last day of such Plan Year and after the application of all amendments required or permitted by the IRS.  \nNo amendment to the Plan will be effective to eliminate or restrict an optional form of benefit. The preceding sentence will not apply to a \nPlan amendment that eliminates or restricts the ability of a Participant to receive payment of their Individual Account under a particular \noptional form of benefit if the amendment provides a single-sum distribution form. Where this Plan document is being adopted to \n7.07 \nPLAN MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION \nIn the case of any merger or consolidation of the Plan with, or transfer of assets or liabilities of such Plan to, any other plan, each \nParticipant will be entitled to receive benefits immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the Plan had then terminated) that \nare equal to or greater than the benefits they would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation, or \ntransfer (if the Plan had then terminated). The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) has the authority to enter into merger agreements or \nagreements to directly transfer the assets of this Plan, but only if such agreements are made with trustees or custodians of other \nretirement plans described in Code section 401(a) or such other plans permitted by laws or regulations. If it is later determined that all or \npart of a non-elective transfer was ineligible to be transferred into the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any ineligible amounts, \nplus earnings or losses attributable thereto (determined in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)), be returned to the transferor \nplan or correct the ineligible transfer using any other method permitted by the IRS under regulation or other guidance. \n7.08 \nPERMANENCY \nThe Employer expects to continue this Plan and make the necessary contributions thereto indefinitely, but such continuance and payment \nis not assumed as a contractual obligation. Neither the Adoption Agreement nor the Plan nor any amendment or modification thereof nor \nthe making of contributions hereunder will be construed as giving any Participant or any other person any legal or equitable right against \nthe Employer, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), the Plan Administrator, or the Pre-approved Document Provider except as \nspecifically provided herein, or as provided by law. \nPage 32 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \n7.09 \nMETHOD AND PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION \nThe Plan may be terminated by the Adopting Employer at any time by appropriate action of its managing body. Such termination will be \neffective on the date specified by the Adopting Employer. The Plan shall terminate, if required by either the IRS or the DOL, if the Adopting \nEmployer is dissolved or terminated. Written notice of the termination and effective date thereof will be given to the Trustee (or Custodian, if \napplicable), Plan Administrator, Pre-approved Document Provider, and the Participants and Beneficiaries of deceased Participants. The required \nfilings (such as the Form 5500 series and others) must be made by the Adopting Employer with the IRS and any other regulatory body as \nrequired by current laws and regulations. Until all of the assets have been distributed from the Fund, the Adopting Employer must keep the \nPlan in compliance with current laws and regulations by making appropriate amendments to the Plan and by taking such other measures as \nmay be required. If the Plan is abandoned by the Adopting Employer, however, a qualified termination administrator (QTA) (or other entity \npermitted by the IRS or DOL) may terminate the Plan according to rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL. \nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, a reversion to the Employer of amounts contributed to the Plan that exceed the \nlimitations imposed under Code section 415(c) may occur upon termination of the Plan according to rules promulgated by the IRS.  \n7.10 \nCONTINUANCE OF PLAN BY SUCCESSOR EMPLOYER \nNotwithstanding the preceding Plan Section 7.09, a successor of the Adopting Employer may continue the Plan and be substituted in the \nplace of the present Adopting Employer. The successor and the present Adopting Employer (or, if deceased, the executor of the estate of a \ndeceased Self-Employed Individual who was the Adopting Employer) must execute a written instrument authorizing such substitution, and \nthe successor shall amend the Plan in accordance with Plan Section 7.06. \n7.11 \nCORRECTION \nThe Employer may correct operational errors or issues involving the Plan in accordance with correction programs established by or \nguidance issued from the IRS or such other correction methods allowed by statute, regulation or regulatory authority. For example, the \nEmployer must correct any Excess Annual Additions allocated to a Participant, the inclusion of ineligible employees or the exclusion of \neligible Participants using any method permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) or allowed by the IRS \nor DOL under regulations or other guidance. EPCRS is currently described in Revenue Procedure 2016-51. To the extent that a correction \nrequires a repayment to the Plan of improperly distributed benefits, the Employer or Plan Administrator may take action to recover such \namounts from the respective Participants or Beneficiaries.  \nIf the Plan fails to retain its qualified status, the Plan will no longer be considered to be part of a pre-approved plan, and such Employer \ncan no longer participate under this pre-approved. In such event, the Plan will be considered an individually designed plan. \n7.12 \nGOVERNING LAWS AND PROVISIONS \nTo the extent such laws are not preempted by federal law, the terms and conditions of this Plan will be governed by the laws of the state in \nwhich the Pre-approved Document Provider is located, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Pre-approved Document Provider and \nthe Employer. \nIn the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Basic Plan Document and provisions of the Adoption Agreement, the summary \nplan description, or any related documents, the Basic Plan Document will control. \n7.13 \nSTATE COMMUNITY PROPERTY LAWS \nThe terms and conditions of this Plan will be applicable without regard to the community property laws of any state. \n7.14 \nHEADINGS \nThe headings of the Plan have been inserted for convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in any construction of the provisions \nhereof. \n7.15 \nGENDER AND NUMBER \nWhenever any words are used herein in the masculine gender, they will be construed as though they were also used in the feminine \ngender in all cases where they would so apply, and whenever any words are used herein in the singular form, they will be construed as \nthough they were also used in the plural form in all cases where they would so apply. \n7.16 \nSTANDARD OF FIDUCIARY CONDUCT \nThe Employer, Plan Administrator, Trustee, and any other Fiduciary under this Plan shall discharge their duties with respect to this Plan \nsolely in the interests of Participants and their Beneficiaries, and with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then \nprevailing that a prudent person acting in like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like \nunder either the Code or ERISA. \n7.17 \nGENERAL UNDERTAKING OF ALL PARTIES \nAll parties to this Plan and all persons claiming any interest whatsoever hereunder agree to perform any and all acts and execute any and \nall documents and papers that may be necessary or desirable for the carrying out of this Plan and any of its provisions. \n7.18 \nAGREEMENT BINDS HEIRS, ETC. \nThis Plan shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns as those terms will apply to any and all parties \nhereto, present and future. \nPage 33 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \n7.19 \nDETERMINATION OF TOP-HEAVY STATUS \nA. \n Except as provided in Plan Section 7.19(B), this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan if any of the following conditions exist: \n1.\nif the top-heavy ratio for this Plan exceeds 60 percent and this Plan is not part of any Required Aggregation Group or Permissive\nAggregation Group of plans;\n2.\nif this Plan is part of a Required Aggregation Group of plans but not part of a Permissive Aggregation Group and the top-heavy\nratio for the group of plans exceeds 60 percent; or\n3.\nif this Plan is a part of a Required Aggregation Group and part of a Permissive Aggregation Group of plans and the top-heavy\nratio for the Permissive Aggregation Group exceeds 60 percent.\nB.\nTop-Heavy Ratio\n1.\nIf the Employer maintains one or more defined contribution plans (including any simplified employee pension plan) and the\nEmployer has not maintained any defined benefit plan that during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date(s) has\nor has had accrued benefits, the top-heavy ratio for this Plan alone or for the Required or Permissive Aggregation Group as\nappropriate is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the account balances of all Key Employees as of the\nDetermination Date(s) (including any part of any account balance distributed in the one-year period ending on the\nDetermination Date(s) (five-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other\nthan Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years\n5beginning before January 1, 2002)) and the denominator of which is the sum of all account balances (including any part of any\naccount balance distributed in the one-year period ending on the Determination Date(s), (five-year period ending on the\nDetermination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability\nand in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002)) both computed in\naccordance with Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations. Both the numerator and the denominator of the top-\nheavy ratio are increased to reflect any contribution not actually made as of the Determination Date, but that is required to be\ntaken into account on that date under Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations.\n2.\nIf the Employer maintains one or more defined contribution plans (including any simplified employee pension plan) and the\nEmployer maintains or has maintained one or more defined benefit plans that during the five-year period ending on the\nDetermination Date(s) has or has had any accrued benefits, the top-heavy ratio for any Required or Permissive Aggregation Group,\nas appropriate, is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of account balances under the aggregated defined contribution plan\nor plans for all Key Employees, determined in accordance with 1) above, and the Present Value of accrued benefits under the\naggregated defined benefit plan or plans for all Key Employees as of the Determination Date(s), and the denominator of which is the\nsum of the account balances under the aggregated defined contribution plan or plans for all Participants, determined in accordance\nwith 1) above, and the Present Value of accrued benefits under the defined benefit plan or plans for all Participants as of the\nDetermination Date(s), all determined in accordance with Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations. The accrued benefits\nunder a defined benefit plan in both the numerator and denominator of the top-heavy ratio are increased for any distribution of an\naccrued benefit made in the one-year period ending on the Determination Date (five-year period ending on the Determination Date \nin the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining\nwhether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002).\n3.\nFor purposes of (1) and (2) above, the value of account balances and the Present Value of accrued benefits will be determined as of\nthe most recent Valuation Date that falls within or ends with the 12-month period ending on the Determination Date, except as\nprovided in Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations for the first and second plan years of a defined benefit plan. The\naccount balances and accrued benefits of a Participant 1) who is not a Key Employee but who was a Key Employee in a prior year, or\n2) who has not been credited with at least one Hour of Service with any employer maintaining the plan at any time during the one-\nyear period (five-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance\nfrom Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1,\n2002) ending on the Determination Date will be disregarded. The calculation of the top-heavy ratio, and the extent to which \ndistributions, rollovers, and transfers are taken into account will be made in accordance with Code section 416 and the\ncorresponding regulations. Deductible employee contributions will not be taken into account for purposes of computing the top-\nheavy ratio. When aggregating plans, the value of account balances and accrued benefits will be calculated with reference to the\nDetermination Dates that fall within the same calendar year.\nThe accrued benefit of a Participant other than a Key Employee will be determined under 1) the method, if any, that uniformly \napplies for accrual purposes under all defined benefit plans maintained by the Employer, or 2) if there is no such method, as if such \nbenefit accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under the fractional rule of Code section 411(b)(1)(C). \n7.20 \nINALIENABILITY OF BENEFITS \nNo benefit or interest available under the Plan will be subject to assignment or alienation, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The preceding \nsentence will not apply to judgments and settlements described in Code section 401(a)(13)(C) and ERISA section 206(d)(4). Such sentence \nwill, however, apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a \nDomestic Relations Order, unless such order is determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as defined in the Definitions section \nof the Plan. \nPage 34 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \nGenerally, a Domestic Relations Order cannot be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order until January 1, 1985. However, in the case of a \nDomestic Relations Order entered before January 1, 1985, the Plan Administrator: \n1.\nshall treat such order as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order if the Plan Administrator is paying benefits pursuant to such order on\nJanuary 1, 1985; and\n2.\nmay treat any other such order entered before January 1, 1985, as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order even if such order does not\nmeet the requirements of Code section 414(p).\nNotwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, a distribution to an Alternate Payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order \nwill be permitted even if the Participant affected by such order is not otherwise entitled to a distribution, and even if such Participant has \nnot attained the earliest retirement age as defined in Code section 414(p). \n7.21 \nBONDING \nEvery Fiduciary and every person who handles funds or other property of the Plan shall be bonded to the extent required by ERISA section \n412 and the corresponding regulations for purposes of protecting the Plan against loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty on the \npart of the person, group, or class, alone or in connivance with others, to be covered by such bond. The amount of the bond will be fixed \nat the beginning of each Plan Year and will not be less than ten-percent of the amount of funds handled. The amount of funds handled will \nbe determined by the funds handled the previous Plan Year or, if none, the amount of funds estimated, in accordance with rules provided \nby the Secretary of Labor, to be handled during the current Plan Year. Notwithstanding the preceding, no bond will be less than $1,000 nor \nmore than $500,000, except that the Secretary of Labor will have the right to prescribe an amount in excess of $500,000. In the case of a \nPlan that holds employer securities (within the meaning of ERISA section 407(d)(1)), the maximum bond amount is $1,000,000 or such \nother amount as the Secretary of Labor prescribes. \n7.22 \nINVESTMENT AUTHORITY \n Except as provided in Plan Section 7.22(B) (relating to individual direction of investments by Participants), the \nAdopting Employer, not the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), will have exclusive management and control over the investment of \nthe Fund into any permitted investment. The Adopting Employer will be responsible for establishing a funding policy statement on \nbehalf of the Plan and shall provide a copy of such funding policy statement to the Trustee who has the authority or discretion to \nselect the appropriate investments for the Fund, if any. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Trustee has the authority or discretion \nto select the appropriate investments for the Fund, such Trustee may enter into an agreement with the Adopting Employer whereby \nthe Trustee will manage the investment of all or a portion of the Fund. Any such agreement will be in writing and will set forth such \nmatters as such Trustee deems necessary or desirable. \n Each Participant will have the responsibility for directing the Trustee (or Custodian, if \nprovided for under a separate agreement between the Adopting Employer and the Custodian), regarding the investment of all or part \nof their Individual Account. If all of the requirements pertaining to Participant direction of investment in ERISA section 404(c)(1) are \nsatisfied, then to the extent so directed, the Adopting Employer, Plan Administrator, Trustee, Custodian (if applicable), and all other \nFiduciaries are relieved of Fiduciary liability under ERISA section 404.  \nThe Plan Administrator shall direct that a Separate Fund be established in the name of each Participant who directs the investment of part \nor all of their Individual Account. Each Separate Fund will be charged or credited (as appropriate) with the earnings, gains, losses, or \nual direction. The \nassets subject to individual direction will not be invested in collectibles as that term is defined in Code section 408(m). \nThe Plan Administrator shall establish such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules relating to individual direction as it deems necessary or \nually directed, \n2) the frequency of investment changes, 3) the forms and procedures for making investment changes, and 4) the effect of a Parti\nfailure to make a valid direction.\nThe Plan Administrator may, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory \ndual \ndirection to certain specified investment options (including, but not limited to, certain mutual funds, investment contracts, deposit \naccounts, and group trusts). The Plan Administrator may permit, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, a Beneficiary of a \ndeceased Participant or the Alternate Payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order to individually direct investments in \naccordance with this Plan Section 7.22(B).  \nNotwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, if the Trustee does not have the authority or discretion to select the \nappropriate investments for the Fund, such Participants will furnish investment instruction to the Plan Administrator under procedures \nadopted by the Adopting Employer and/or the Plan Administrator consistent with the Plan, and it will be the responsibility of the Plan \nAdministrator to provide direction to such Trustee regarding the investment of such amounts. If a Participant who has the right to \ndirect investments under the terms of the Plan fails to provide such direction to the Plan Administrator, the Plan Administrator shall \nrest of \neach Participant and/or Beneficiary in the Fund unless the Trustee enters into a written agreement with the Adopting Employer to \nkeep separate accounts for each such Participant or Beneficiary.  \nPage 35 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \nC.\nInvestment Managers\ny appoint one or more investment managers to make investment \ndecisions with respect to all or a portion of the Fund. The investment manager will be any firm or individual registered as an \ninvestment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, a bank as defined in said Act, or an insurance company qualified \nunder the laws of more than one state to perform services consisting of the management, acquisition, or disposition of any \nassets of the Plan.  \nat the direction of the investment manager.

The investments that may be acquired at the direction of \nthe investment manager are those described in Plan Section 7.22(D).  \nwill be by written agreement between the Adopting Employer and \nthe investment manager, and a copy of such agreement (and any modification or termination thereof) must be given to the Trustee\ns \nappointment and an acknowledgment by the investment manager that it is a Fiduciary of the Plan under ERISA. \n4.\nConcerning the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable)\nthe Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of such appointment. Such notice will specify\nCustodian, if applicable) will comply with the investment direction given to it by the investment manager and will not be liable for any\nloss which may result by reason of any action (or inaction) it takes at the direction of the investment manager.\nThe Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) may invest the assets of the Plan in property of any character, real or \npersonal, including, but not limited to, the following: stocks, including Qualifying Employer Securities, and including shares of open-end \ninvestment companies (mutual funds); bonds; notes; debentures; proprietary mutual funds; deposit accounts; options; limited partnership \ninterests; mortgages; real estate or any interests therein (including Qualifying Employer Real Property); unit investment trusts; Treasury \nBills, and other U.S. Government obligations; common trust funds, combined investment trusts, collective trust funds or commingled \nfunds maintained by a bank or similar financial organization (whether or not the Trustee hereunder); savings accounts, certificates of \ndeposit, demand or time deposits or money market accounts of a bank or similar financial organization (whether or not the Trustee \npolicies; or in \nsuch other investments as is deemed proper without regard to investments authorized by statute or rule of law governing the investment \nof trust funds but with regard to ERISA and this Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Pre-approved Document Provider \nmay, as a condition of making the Plan available to the Adopting Employer, limit the types of property in which the assets of the Plan may \nbe invested.

The Amendment is adopted to reflect certain provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA-18) and \nrelated guidance. This Amendment is intended to provide good faith compliance with the BBA-18 and related guidance until the Plan is \nformally restated to incorporate such guidance. The Amendment is effective on the first day of the Plan Year beginning on or after \nJanuary 1, 2019. This Amendment supersedes the existing provisions of the Plan to the extent those provisions are inconsistent with the \nprovisions of the Amendment. The Amendment will not cause the Plan to become an individually designed plan. \nSECTION FIVE: DISTRIBUTIONS AND LOANS TO PARTICIPANTS \nThe Basic Plan Document section entitled Distributions is modified by replacing Section 5.07(C)(2)(a) and (b) with the following: \na.\nHardship Withdrawals of Employer Profit Sharing Contributions - Notwithstanding Plan Section 5.01 (C)(1 ), an Employee may elect to\nreceive a hardship distribution of all or part of the Vested portion of their Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions\nother than those described in Plan Section 5.01 (A)(2), subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.10.\nFor purposes of this Plan Section 5.01 (C)(2)(a), hardship is defined as an immediate and heavy financial need of the Employee\nwhere such Employee lacks other available resources. Financial needs considered immediate and heavy include, but are not limited\nto, 1) expenses incurred or necessary for medical care, described in Code section 213(d), of the Employee, the Employee's Spouse,\ndependents, or the Employee's Primary Beneficiary, 2) the purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence for the\nEmployee, 3) payment of tuition and related educational fees for the next 12 months of post-secondary education for the\nEmployee, the Employee's Spouse, children, dependents, or the Employee's Primary Beneficiary, 4) payment to prevent the eviction\nof the Employee from, or a foreclosure on the mortgage of, the Employee's principal residence, 5) funeral or burial expenses for the\nEmployee's deceased parent, Spouse, child, dependent, or the Employee's Primary Beneficiary, 6) payment to repair damage to the\nEmployee's principal residence that would qualify for a casualty loss deduction under Code section 165 (determined without regard\nto Code section 165(h)(5) and whether the loss exceeds ten-percent of adjusted gross income), and 7) effective for distributions on\nor after January 1, 2018, expenses and losses (including loss of income) incurred by the Employee on account of a disaster declared\nby the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), provided that the Employee's principal residence or principal place of\nemployment at the time of the disaster was located in an area designated by FEMA for individual assistance with respect to the\ndisaster and the Employee did not request a distribution from the Plan for such expenses and losses pursuant to Plan Section\n5.01 (D)(3).\nA distribution will be considered necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need of the Employee only if\ni.\nthe Employee has obtained all currently available distributions (including distributions of ESOP dividends under Code section\n404(k)), other than hardship distributions, under the Plan and all other qualified and nonqualified deferred compensation plans\nof the Employer;\nii.\nthe distribution is not in excess of the amount of an immediate and heavy financial need (including amounts necessary to pay\nany federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution); and\niii.\neffective for distributions on or after January 1, 2020, the Employee provided the Plan Administrator with a representation, in\nwriting (including by using an electronic medium as defined in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)-21(e)(3)), or in such other\nform that may be permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS, that they have insufficient cash or other liquid assets\nreasonably available to satisfy their financial need.\nb.\nHardship Withdrawals of Elective Deferrals- Distribution of Elective Deferrals, including any earnings credited to an Employee's\naccount, may be made to an Employee in the event of hardship. For the purposes of this Plan Section 5.01 (C)(2)(b), hardship is\ndefined as an immediate and heavy financial need of the Employee where the distribution is needed to satisfy the immediate and\nheavy financial need of such Employee. Hardship distributions are subject to the spousal consent requirements contained in Code\nsections 401 (a)(11) and 417, if applicable.\nPage 1 of 2 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \nFor purposes of determining whether an Employee has a hardship, rules similar to those described in Plan Section 5.01 (C)(2)(a) will \napply except that only the financial needs listed above will be considered. Any existing suspension of an Employee's Elective \nDeferrals due to the receipt of a hardship distribution from the Plan will cease to continue as of the first day of the Plan Year \nbeginning on or after January 1, 2019. In addition, the Employee's Elective Deferrals will not be suspended for any period of time \ndue to the receipt of a hardship distribution that is made during the Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 2019. For hardship \ndistributions before 2002, a distribution will be considered as necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need of the \nEmployee only if all plans maintained by the Employer provide that the Employee may not make Elective Deferrals for the \nEmployee's taxable year immediately following the taxable year of the hardship distribution in excess of the applicable limit under \nCode section 402(g) for such taxable year less the amount of such Employee's Elective Deferrals for the taxable year of the hardship \ndistribution. \nSIGNATURE \nThe Pre-approved Document Provider hereby adopts this Amendment on behalf of the Adopting Employers. \nName of Pre-approved Document Provider: _V_ a_n_,g._u_a _rd_F_id_u_c_ia_ry..__T_ru_s_t_C_o_m_,_pa_n_.Y.__ __________________ _ \nSignature Stepkuu'e oL J¼p(er \nDate Signed __ 1 _1 /_2_3_/2_0_2_0 ________ _\nPage 2 of 2 \n©2020 Ascensus, LLC \nThis page is intentionally left blank\nThis page is intentionally left blank\nThis page is intentionally left blank\nP.O.

Specifically, a defined contribution plan is considered top-heavy if the Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) test is met, meaning that the sum of elective deferrals and employer contributions does not exceed 60% of compensation. The definition of compensation varies depending on whether the employee is a W-2 employee or a self-employed individual. For W-2 employees, compensation is defined as information required to be reported under Code sections 6041, 6051, and 6052 (wages, tips, and other compensation as reported on Form W-2). For self-employed individuals, compensation is defined as earned income. The definition also includes any amount that is contributed by the employer pursuant to a salary reduction agreement and that is not includible in the gross income of the employee under Code sections 125, 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), or 403(b). The term \"Top-Heavy Plan\" is also used in the context of discussing the allocation formula for employer contributions, but it is not defined in the text and does not provide any additional details on what a \"Top-Heavy Plan\" is or what it means. The text simply states that the contribution and allocation provisions for a \"Top-Heavy Plan\" will apply for any plan year with respect to which the plan is a \"Top-Heavy Plan\" and will supersede any conflicting provisions in the plan. Based on the text, a \"Top-Heavy Plan\" is some kind of plan that is classified as \"Top-Heavy\", but the text does not give any more details about what that means or what the implications are.", "length": 60405}
{"text": "Brooding Cynyx: 2011\nNYPD INTEL UNIT:\nEVER VIGILANT AND ON THE JOB\nIn a nondescript building in the meat packing district of Lower Manhattan\nan elite team functions as NYC’s own CIA\n(Thursday, May 5, 2011. Westside, Lower Manhattan, NYC) Just a short walk from what has been referred to as “Ground Zero” after the al-Qeada attacks on America at the World Trade Center in September 2001, is another “Ground Zero” that is the polar opposite of the Site just a few blocks away.\nIn the most nondescript of buildings in a neighborhood of remarkably nondescript structures, an elite force of under 50 NYPD Officers work in a hi-tech, dimly lit space tracking via high tech wizardry and high level intellect, potential threats to this City. The NYPD Intelligence Unit is among the most closely guarded, uniquely tasked and analytically capable of any Intelligence Unit on the planet. The men and women who staff this ultra-secret Unit are not assigned here by accident. They have all been “hand-picked” by the Deputy Police Commissioner for Intelligence and Counter-terrorism, David Cohen. And make no mistake about it, Mr. Cohen knows, intimately, the machinations and labyrinthine underworld of terrorism and intelligence gathering, analyzing and dissemination.\nDavid Cohen was a CIA Officer for over thirty years. His career spanned some of the most tumultuous times and global events of the latter decades of the last century. He was an analyst who always seemed to “fall upwards” in his career, rising to a top level position in the Directorate of Operations at a relatively young age.\nAfter the abysmal failures of the entire federal and military intelligence apparatus that came to light in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, Cohen came to New York City and offered his services. He would go on to create one of the mot sophisticated, effective, efficient and capable “intelligence units” in the world. No other City on the planet can boast of a comparable entity. Cohen realized all too well that New York City would remain the primary “target rich environment” that would attract terrorists of every stripe and inclination.\nWhile this Unit has been functioning in its current iteration since 2003, the death of Osama Bin Laden at the hands of Navy SEAL Team Six in his heavily fortified private compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan last Sunday, has people asking if there is a greater threat to New York City as groups or individuals may seek “retaliatory strikes”. The simple answer, according to one Intel Unit Officer is “Yes. Obviously the threat has been constant since 9-11 but with Bin Laden's death, we have ramped up some of our activities here and obviously, out in the field”.\nThe business of intelligence is as much science as it is art. This is true of any endeavor that must account for the unaccountable, for an amount of variables and a level of complexity that eludes quantification. The men and women of the NYPD Intelligence Unit must try to extract from a veritable ocean of “raw data” those few drops that constitute real “actionable intelligence”. This is a daunting and often frustrating task. However, the payoffs, when they are correct, can yield enormously significant results. The killing of Osama Bin Laden is a case in point. Years of intelligence data was collected, sifted through, analyzed, interpreted, vetted and put under intense scrutiny while even more information was sought to corroborate what the raw intelligence was beginning to reveal to the CIA and Pentagon.\nThat very same process is employed here in the NYPD Intel Unit but on a much smaller scale. Certainly, this Unit does not operate in isolation from other intelligence agencies around the world but their primary focus is to identify that one in a million ‘imminent threat’ to the City and residents of New York. Everything from information available in the media and in the public domain, to a very select and fine balance of information sharing with very specific, trusted sources is studied, looking for what? For signs, either covert or intuited, either from within the Five Boroughs or, perhaps from Scotland Yard, Interpol or some other valued, proven to be reliable source, that stands up under the scrutiny it must to be deemed “actionable”.\n“We read everything from the local papers, foreign papers and magazines to intelligence reports from our own people stationed overseas as well as those working the streets here in New York”, commented one Intel Unit member who, due to the nature of what he and his colleagues do, cannot be publicly identified. “Actually”, continued the same Officer, “my own wife does not fully know what I do. She is aware that I am involved in something ‘different’, something sorta ‘top secret’ but, that’s about it.”\nTo enter the loft-like work space of this secretive Unit one is struck by the number of members who just “don’t look like cops”. One senior NYPD Officer who has been assigned to the Intel Unit for the last 6 years continues that, “some of these people were recruited right out of college and I mean the best colleges. They are classic computer nerds. They may have gone to Columbia, MIT, or some Ivy League university and majored in computer science or information technology or some related field. They went to the Police Academy so they could officially become active members of the NYPD but, they have spent their entire careers till now hacking, I mean the ‘good kind’, the ‘white hats’ type hacking and are truly talented and particularly well suited for what we do”.\nOther members have long tenure in the NYPD; some started their careers in a radio cars in the Boroughs, on the streets and worked their ways up to higher rank, some had made Detective in their former Commands. It can be an odd mix but, given the mission they have been tasked with, they appear to work cohesively. The sense of “mission” is palpable among them. “I know what I am doing may help save lives of New Yorkers, maybe members of my own family or friends. I was on duty on 9-11-01 and responded. Since then I have been, in a way, obsessed. I have felt it necessary to try to understand our adversaries, the ‘nature of the threats’”, commented one female analyst who began her NYPD career in a rough Precinct sector in the Brooklyn South Patrol Command. She added with a wry smile, “everyday I walk in here I know I’m not in Brooklyn anymore”. Besides her experience on the dark and dirty streets of Brooklyn South, her degree from a prestigious university, her mutli-lingualness and her passion for “The Job”, attracted the attention of David Cohen. With little fanfare or paperwork she was suddenly reassigned. “One day I’m working cases in Brooklyn, two days later I’m here and beginning my ‘immersion training’. It was like, ‘Whoa. I knew we (NYPD) were on top of things but I never realized to what extent our Intel and Counter-terrorism Units functioned”.\nAlthough this tightly knit Unit may have been the “brainchild” of David Cohen, it was NYPD Commissioner, Ray Kelly and Mayor Michael Bloomberg who recognized the value of creating such a Unit and saw that the “return on the investment” would, potentially, be enormous. As Commissioner Kelly himself commented in an interview not that long ago, “We are doing all these things because New York is still the No. 1 target. We have been targeted four times, twice successfully, and the city remains the most symbolic, substantive target for the terrorists. These are cunning, patient, deliberate people who want to kill us and kill us in big numbers.\"\nLydia Khalil, former counter terrorism analyst with the NYPD Intelligence and Counter Terrorism Units, knows all too well how \"cunning, patient and deliberate\" the people are who truly seek to do us harm. Currently a Fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, Khalil has spoken publicly regarding the Intel Unit’s efficacy since she resigned from her position with NYPD to pursue other opportunities. She is an internationally recognized expert on the Middle East and, in particular, on the conditions in Middle Eastern countries that foment hatred of the West among the largely disenfranchised youths. While with The NYPD Ms. Khalil focused on international terrorism trends and terrorism cases in the Middle East, Africa and Europe.\nAccording to Khalil, we, as a Nation and as a City, must strive to understand the true nature of our enemies. Khalil has also been an outspoken proponent for the American Muslim / Islamic communities. She has written that some of the most “valuable, actionable intelligence” NYPD has obtained over the last 9 plus years has come from within the New York City Metropolitan Area Muslim community.\n“This is an important thing to remember. The Muslims that live among us here in New York City, who pray at Mosques in all five Boroughs, have a vested interest in providing us with information. Some good, kind hearted Imam out in Queens sees a few members who show up regularly for prayer suddenly become hostile and isolated. He senses something not right. He calls us. The people of New York City are among the most understanding and accepting of each other because we really don’t have a choice. But, the Muslim community has felt a particular brand of hostility, even hatred, since September 11, 2001 and they want to help us more than anyone. After all, it is their very religion, their faith, that is called to question, that has raised suspicions. I give them all the credit in the world for stepping up as they have”, explained an Intel Unit Officer who identified himself as Jack.\nIf an average New Yorker could walk in off the street and spend some time in this place, they would, no doubt, leave here feeling that much better about their City, that much better about their NYPD and about their security.\nThe Feds created the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of fear and embarrassment. It has been a colossal failure, at least as seen by NYPD. Our entire federal intelligence apparatus was a colossal failure and dropped the ball regarding September 11, 2001. That is precisely why NYPD is doing what they are. \" We won’t be fooled again\".\nAs Jack told us, as he concluded our conversation, “Our Town, Our People, Our Business. We’ll take care of our own. I promise you that”.\nTags: NYPD Intelligence Unit, NYPD Counter terrorism Unit, Deputy Commissioner Cohen, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly, Lydia Khalil, Securing NYC, Target Rich Environment, Homeland Security.\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/2009/01/30/the-spymaster-of-new-york.html\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cohen_%28intelligence%29\nhttp://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/the_nypd_post_osama_challenge_YWMrG88tcrYAytmGsHo1VM\nhttp://cryptome.org/nypd-upnose.htm\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/07/25/050725fa_fact2?currentPage=all\nhttp://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/intelligence_co.shtml\nhttp://cryptome.org/eyeball/cohen/cohen-eyeball.htm\nhttp://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/n_8286/\nLabels: Current events, Homeland Security, Intelligence, National Security, News Commentary, NYC, NYPD, Osma Bin Laden, Tri-Sate Area\nLIFE HAS GONE ON:\nFOREVER ALTERED, BUT THE BEAT GOES ON\nCynyc would like to express here our tremendous sense of gratitude to the members (active and retired) of the FDNY, NYPD and PAPD who responded to the World Trade Center Site on September 11, 2001 and have been gracious enough to share their thoughts with us.\nWe are equally respectful and appreciative to those who lost husbands, wives, fathers, sons and daughters, their friends and relatives at the WTC and those whom have generously and candidly agreed to share their thoughts, open their hearts and answer our questions to make the following Post possible. All of these people who have shared with us did so with the understanding, by their own requests, that their identities would remain private for their own personal reasons. We have promised each of them that they would remain anonymous.At the end of this post the reader will find a partial list of links to some of the FDNY, NYPD and PAPD Memorial Pages for some of those who spoke to us for this post as well as some of the last duty assignments for those they spoke of and for.\n(Tuesday, May 3, 2011. New York City) There was not much cheering or celebrating, no buoyant chanting of “USA,USA, USA”, in the Firehouses and Police Precinct Station Houses as word spread that Osama Bin Laden was dead. Most of the cheering, oddly ebullient crowds were out on the streets in places like Times Square, Battery Park and up and down the corridors of Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and The Bronx. Most of the celebrants hooting and hollering, wildly waving American flags probably had few real memories of that day in September 2001 when our City, our Country and our World changed.\nAs the local TV news began to confirm the initial reports, before President Obama addressed the Nation from the East Room of The White House, a certain, distinct silence ensued in apartments and houses across the Tri-State Area, in the residences that had been homes to so many of the thousands who perished on that bright September morning almost ten years ago, victims of that man, so recently killed by United States Navy SEALs half a world away.\nThe world’s most wanted man did not die the noble death of the warrior he claimed to be. he did not go out in a blaze of glory. Rather, when the SEALs entered the room in which he hide, he grabbed one of his wives and a firearm. Using this particular wife as a human shield he chose not to obey the orders shouted at him to surrender. His death was a cowardly act, perhaps a true reflection of the devious mind and darkened soul who ordered and financed the attacks on America in 2001.\nHis death came by way of two bullets, as has been reported by the Pentagon. Likely the first shot, the one that pierced one of his eyes before exploding his cranium and brain into a cloud of bloody mist and fragments, killed him instantly. Perhaps, if he had a nanosecond to have a thought, it might have been that the Americans have found me. He chose not to surrender and was summarily killed quickly, cleanly, efficiently in a manner far more merciful than those who perished on 4 hijacked airplanes, at The Pentagon, in an unremarkable field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania and in our Twin Towers.\nMaybe he was welcomed to Paradise by 72 virgins. Maybe he was well received in Hell. Who knows. One beefy FDNY veteran from Ladder 24 commented,”It don’t really matter does it? I mean, okay, the scumbag is gone but, we got a wall full of pictures of guys we lost that day. Engine 1 lost that day. Am I glad he’s dead? Sure. But what does it mean?” As humans we are wired to search for “meaning” in events large and small particularly when they have forever altered our internal conscious landscape.\n“I went down there with my guys to do whatever we could. I remembered the bombing in 1993, I was on the job then, in Patrol in the 13th Precinct. September 11 will always be something I can’t get outta my head. No, it doesn’t get in the way or, at least not very often. So, this piece of shit is dead? Good. I believe in hell because I grew up believing in it and I saw it on that day. I hope Bin Laden is there”, said a 28 year veteran of NYPD who assisted in the evacuation of the South Tower.\nThere is a story for every person who was in those buildings, in The Pentagon and on those doomed jets. There are amazing stories of self sacrifice and heroism, some known, some known only to God. Each of those who was present that day and survived has spent at least a portion of the past 3521 days seeking answers, searching for meaning and, oddly perhaps, living with some sense of guilt, with some part of their innermost self wondering how and why they survived while so many didn’t.\nNot every women is cut out to be the wife of an NYPD Officer or an FDNY Firefighter. The stress of “the job” takes tolls on relationships and marriages that is often too much for a spouse to bear. “I always knew when my husband walked out the door to go to work there was a risk...a chance, he would not come home. I came to dread the phone call in the middle of the night telling me which hospital he was in. It didn’t happen that way. I’ve raised our three daughters these last ten years. Our youngest was born on September 21, 2001. She never knew her Dad. That breaks my heart sometimes but, then I realize, my heart is already broken. It can’t get broke more than it is but sometimes it just does”. Those are the words of a beautiful, intelligent widow who has nothing left of her husband except memories and “three wonderful girls”, who was last heard from as he approached the 78th floor of the North Tower. “All they ever recovered to identify him was his service piece. His gun. I have it and keep it wrapped up and hidden. I never did like the fact that he had guns in the house. Bin Laden, I do believe with all my heart that I could have shot him had I had the chance. What he took from me is something I can’t fully explain”, she continued before her tears began to flow.\nMost of the members of Service from the FDNY and NYPD who survived that event will say that “only in New York” could such an amazing amount of “citizens\", civilians, calmly, orderly and with an absolute absence of fear or panic evacuate those Twin Towers as they did. “Sure, the training after the February 1993 bombing was crucial to the fact that so many of us survived”, said an accountant who made his way down from the 59th floor of the North Tower. “We had Fire Marshals. Each company on each floor had someone who was the designated Fire Marshall. Shit, we’d drill...kinda like in grade school..we actually had fucking fire drills. Those drills, my fiend, saved thousands of lives”.\nOne third generation NYPD Detective noted that, “As New Yorkers, we are used to things fucking up. The subway suddenly stops in a tunnel, no air conditioning, no lights. We give it a good 15, 20 minutes tops before we start to wonder. We’re used to things going wrong. After all, we live in a city of 10 million with God knows how many visitors and tourists in town a day. Had we known the North Tower was hit intentionally by a commercial jet and that the South Tower had already collapsed, I don’t know, honestly, if we would have made it out”. “Literally, after the dust and debris settled it dawned on me I was still alive. I was shocked. I could hardly breath and really couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. But, after awhile, I don’t know if it was 30 minutes or an hour, I heard sounds...I heard voices...I heard sirens. I crawled towards the sounds I heard. I found a guy under a car. I grabbed his hand, drug him out from under the car and told him, ‘Listen to me cuz, we’re okay. Now, let’s move our asses outta here’. We walked west. Suddenly after walking like what seemed a mile, we ran into some other guys from the job. After that, I think I passed out for a few minutes. Next thing I remember was waking up with (name with held) tossing bottled water in my face”, said a MOS of FDNY from a Ladder Company in Brooklyn that lost many members.\n343 members of FDNY were killed on September 11, 2001. 23 MOS of NYPD lost their lives and 37 PAPD Officers also perished. Some Firehouses lost entire companies; others suffered losses in double digits. As Mayor Guiliani later answered a reporters question saying “ The loss of life will probably be more than we can bear, we can only imagine. It is beyond our grasp at this time”. The innocent civilians: the brokers and traders, the cooks, custodians and window washers; the secretaries, executive assistants, CEOs, VPs, CFOs who were killed were, in a way, sadder losses to the Tri-State Area than were the tragic deaths of the MOS.\nCops, Firemen and other First Responders are expected to run into environments from which everyone else is frantically running out of. They sign on to that the day they take the oath. Those people who showed up for work, on time, that gorgeous New York morning probably never gave a moments thought to their own mortality or the random nature of chaos and evil as they commuted by bus, subway, bike and walk to work on that morning. “I remember thinking to myself”, began a veteran Homicide Detective assigned to the recovery effort, “that the parts of these people we were finding, the ‘biologics’ as they were called, ever gave a moments thought that morning that that day could be their last. At least, as a cop, I was in touch with how quickly my life and the life of my family could change. I don’t know how to explain it to you, ya know what I mean”?\nLife has gone on. Tens years is a long time especially in the life of a child. So many children across the Tri-State don’t have clear memories of their Moms and Dads, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles. Many of those children whose lives have been defined by the events of September 11, 2001 were those who took to the streets in NYC and DC while their surviving parent stayed home watching the news and, of course, searching for meaning. Each has their own private pain, each, their own private mechanism that has allowed them to cope and function from that day until today. Will the death of Osama Bin Laden somehow provide them “closure” or a sense of justice, retribution or solace? Only they can answer and their answers are probably as diverse as they are disparate.\nSadly, 9-11-01 is still killing. Hundreds of First Responders, the underpaid MOS from FDNY, NYPD and PAPD as well as the hundreds of steel workers, welders and construction workers who toiled at “The Pile” for months after 9-11-01, have died from exposure to the toxins in the air at the WTC Site. Odd malignancies and other respiratory and autoimmune diseases plague them and some are so sick that their deaths are immanent. Many have had to swallow enormous lumps of pride and accept disability retirement because they could no longer function in the manner their jobs, jobs they devoted their lives to, requires. Still others, haven’t the energy to swallow their pride. They live their lives in the shadow of sites, sounds, smells, sensations and memories. Several have found the intervening years too tough and have taken their own lives. In a sense, each one of us who has survived exists with the profound sense of being on “borrowed time”.\nSo be it. Some of us may, on occasion believe, at least on some spiritual or neural level that our survival was meant to be. Again, who knows. We talk and debate in hushed tones on the phone about the death of Osama Bin Laden. We disagree about aspects of it from its overall significance in America’s ongoing battle against terrorist elements seeking to inflict us harm. We wonder what his capture might have meant. we ask each other how we feel about his death and if it really makes any difference in what we lived through and live with. We are permitted our disagreements; we’ve earned them. We speak with the wives and children of the men we once called Brothers and do what we can for them.\nWe all realize that they have the strength and resolve to do fro themselves what non of us could ever do for them. We mourn our friends and strangers alike. We think about the people we carried on our backs from one floor to the next in the North and South Towers. Some of them, we know their status; others of them, we haven’t a clue. All we know is we got out while some of the best of the best, civilian and public servant did not.\nThe Obama Administration reports that Bin Laden’s corpse was given up to the sea. New York City is a port town, a coastal city. We understand the power and infinite depths of the waters that wash with amazing regularity on our shores.\nLife has gone on and will continue to do so. The moon will wax and wane and induce our tides accordingly. Perhaps, someday, years from now, a young child will find a sun and salt bleached bone fragment out in Coney Island or Jones Beach. Who knows whose bone that may be?\nIf cosmic justice exists in some form or any fashion, the child who finds that bone fragment will toss it back into the surf.\nThe sea tells know tales.\nTo all of those who died on September 11, 2001, we wish you a peaceful rest Safely Home.\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/library/national/091101rescuers.html\nhttp://www.afge171.org/news/911/POLICE.HTM\nhttp://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/html/memorial/index.shtml\nhttp://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/home/memorial.shtml\nhttp://our.homewithgod.com/mkcathy/portauthority.html\nPosted Tuesday, May 3, 2011 @ 5:45PM EST\nLabels: 9-11-01, Current events, FDNY, Members of Service, Navt SEALs, News Commentary, NYC, NYPD, Osma Bin Laden, Tri-Sate Area\nOSAMA BIN LADEN FINALLY KILLED\nMEMBERS OF THE FDNY READ THE NEWS ON THE TIMES SQUARE TICKER\n(Monday, May 2, 2011. NY, NY) After being the most wanted fugitive in the world and the very face of radical extremist Islamic terrorism for nearly the past ten years, the man who masterminded the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City and at The Pentagon, Osama Bin Laden, has been killed in a daring operation carried out by US Special Forces and CIA Operatives. The particulars of the raid that resulted in this much celebrated milestone in our on-going “War on Terror” are headlines around the world and dominating cable TV news coverage.\nThe news considered so important to our government and the American people that President Obama made a late night, unscheduled televised address to report the news from the East Room in the White House. The President's quote that “Justice has been Done” has appeared in bold headlines all over the world. As word spread last night that Bin Laden had been killed in a camp in Pakistan, crowds gathered at various sites in New York City and Washington,DC to mark the occasion. There was an odd “carnival like” atmosphere reported by some present in the cheering, chanting throngs outside the White House last night while at the site where the World Trade Centers stood, the mood was mixed.\nDuring most of the last decade, actually since October 16, 2001 when CIA Operatives and Special Forces were first covertly inserted into Afghanistan to capture or kill as many members of al Qaeda and their hosts, The Taliban, our intervention there has been full of irony. In a matter of weeks after our official military campaign began, in earnest, in Afghanistan, is has been widely acknowledged by military and government officials, that the titular head and spirit leader of al Qaeda – Bin Laden – was “trapped” in the rugged mountains of Tora Bora and was able to slip across the border into Pakistan. “We had him and we let him get away”, commented a top ranking CIA Operative who had been there. Then President George W. Bush refused the military's and CIA requests to insert a larger troop force to seal the Afghan – Pakistan border. Instead, Bush “outsourced” the Pakistani border mission to Pakistani forces many of whom had tribal and ideological sympathies with both Bin Laden and his “mujaheddin” forces and The Taliban.\nSince that time Bin Laden's whereabouts had been a “huge mystery” and a “constant reminder of our lost opportunities” according to the same CIA Operative. In the intervening years our military efforts to secure Afghanistan and allow for some sort of homegrown government to “step up” and secure their own Country have been noteworthy only because of their many victories, though most were merely Pyrrhic at best, and constant set backs our military have experienced. It has become a high stakes game of cat-and-mouse as, over the years first The Taliban fell from power, al Qaeda was in disarray only to watch as both entities have seen resurgence in recent years and have proven to be more tenacious than initially expected.\nThe puppet regime of Afghan “President” Harmid Karzai, hand picked by the Cheney / Bush Administration to take over in the wake of the Taliban's retreat in late 2001 has been an abject failure in every measurable way. If anything Afghanistan today, despite the billions of US dollars we've poured in to that perpetually corrupt, lawless, failed Nation / State is not all that much different that it was prior to September 11, 2001. This fact is not a reflection on our dedicated and brave troops but rather on the Cheney / Bush Administration and civilian Pentagon and State Department leadership from 2001 through the inauguration of President Obama in January 2009.\nBut now, 3519 days since the 9-11-01 attacks, Osama Bin Laden is dead; killed, according to military after action reports, by a bullet to the head. His body was recovered and was allegedly positively identified using comparative DNA analysis. Since the elite United State Navy SEALs, arguably the most capable of all our Special Forces Troops, conducted the raid and scored “the hit”, Bin Laden was “buried at sea” and done so within 24 hours of his death in deference to Muslim tradition. It is also important to note that only three other people are reported to have been killed during the raid on his 8 acre compound just outside the Pakistani city of Abbottabad. “This was a precision strike, a surgical operation with a singular focus and mission objective”, commented a senior Pentagon official speaking anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the raid into Pakistan.\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/world/asia/osama-bin-laden-is-killed.html?hp\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/world/02osama-bin-laden-obituary.html?hp\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/05/02/2011-05-02_us_spies_eyed_bin_laden_compound_for_year.html\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/05/02/2011-05-02_justice_done_but_greatness_has_always_been.html\nhttp://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/us_raiders_slay_beast_QgxwTCzo6XLjib9bJKPckK\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/osama-bin-laden-is-killed-by-us-forces-in-pakistan/2011/05/01/AFXMZyVF_story.html?hpid=z2\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/al-qaeda-threat-more-diffuse-but-persistent/2011/05/01/AFt4KZWF_story.html?hpid=z3\nPosted Monday, May 2, 2011 @ 9:11AM EST\nPosted by Brooding Cynyc at 9:11 AM No comments:\nLabels: Current events, Intelligence, National Security, News Commentary, Political Commentary\n“Mayday - an internationally recognized distress signal”\n(From the Oxford English Dictionary)\nOUR SOCIETY IS IN DISTRESS: LAW ENFORCEMENT MEMBERS ARE BEING KILLED AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE\n(May 1, 2011. NY, NY) Their names and locales are as diverse as is our Country and the jurisdictions they serve. Men and women from the largest, sprawling urban megalopolises to the smallest rural counties and towns are part of a tragic litany. That they are being killed, murdered actually, at an alarming rate seems to not have the newsworthiness the media animal requires to be fed. While each of these heartbreaking fatalities individually have been headline news in their respective localities, collectively they have yet to resonate nationally.\nNo sector of the Law Enforcement Community (LEC) seems to have been spared. Agencies and Departments at the federal, state, county and municipal levels have suffered in the \"Line of Duty” (LOD) deaths; so far, this year, alone, 65 Members of Service (MOS) have died “On The Job”; (OTJ) 32 of these fatalities were from gunshots. No, this is not going to be a rant about “gun control” or access to firearms. Neither will this be a sweeping indictment of the failures, in many cases, in mental health availability and affordability. Those are valid topics for another time, another discussion but not at all relevant to this particular discussion of facts.\nThis is more about society, our society, America's society as of late April 2011 - where we as a society have been, currently are and, perhaps, in certain respects, where we are going.\nThere is inherent in our society a contract, a compact or, perhaps a covenant that we collectively abide by. We are a nation of laws and, as such, most of the populace abides within the constraints of that concept. Most folks don’t steal, rob, assault, rape, murder or otherwise “break the law” not because they are disinclined. No. Most live their lives within the well defined boundaries of “The Law” for fear of getting caught. Some might argue that this sentiment is a poor reflection of our society. Those that would argue that most people are disinclined to break the law are so predisposed not for fear of discovery but rather because they are simply disinclined - they are “good, honest people”. It’s a tough task to argue to the contrary but, given the tone and tenor of today’s America, it has become more difficult to believe. Those in the LEC struggle mightily with this issue, daily, sometimes hourly.There exists among members of the LEC the notion that we constitute a “Thin Blue Line”. This notion or, actually, a belief, is that given the size of our population juxtaposed against the size of the LEC, the ratio is so disproportionate as to be as frightening as it is perilously inefficient. The concept of “The Thin Blue Line” is representative of the fact that the LEC constitutes the fabric of our society that connotes “The Law”. It is this knowledge of the existence of “The Law” as an intricate component of our society that maintains the level of order that permits us, collectively and individually, to live out our daily lives free of the burden of fear, of impending anarchy.The stark fact is that roughly 10% of our population is responsible for 100% of the crime that plagues us. Perhaps that fact makes the challenge to the LEC a fairer fight. Who knows. Crime is more familiar than it is random. The overwhelming majority of homicides, for example, are perpetrated by people known to each other. Stranger on stranger murder is far rarer than TV shows and popular novels lead us to believe. Yes, oh yes, there are predators, serial killers, sexual predators and every variety of emotionally deranged persons (EDP’s) who roam our streets in communities large and small. They will always be there, they always have.\nAmerica today is home to almost 310 million people. The LEC numbers approximately 600,000 members. If you add in all the non publicly oriented-Law Enforcement Agents employed by the federal government such as the Sate Department Security Unit, The Secret Service, and the like, the total number of sworn LEO’s approaches 800,000. Roughly calculated, for every 400 American residents there is a single LEO. Not a good ratio particularly in some of the more densely populated areas.\nSo the fabric of our Thin Blue Line is already stretched pretty thinly from coast to coast. Each death of a MOS of the LEC is one less fiber in an already threadbare fabric, the fabric that we all rely on, take for granted or merely presume to be “out there”. And, that we are. The Members of Service of every Law Enforcement Agency in the Nation are “out there” 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. It has been horrifying to read at least weekly so far this year, of the death of another MOS. The scenarios that have claimed their lives have run the gamut from the “routine” traffic stop that goes bad quickly, to shoot-outs, standoffs between lone gunmen and Deputies, Border Patrol Agents working one of the most treacherous beats on our southern border and other incidents with unique details but all with a similar outcome. One less fiber of our fraying Thin Blue Line fabric is “out there” doing what they have each sworn to do.\nA Part of America Died\nSomebody killed a policeman today, and a part of America died. A piece of our country he swore to protect, will be buried with him at his side. The suspect who shot him will stand up in court, with counsel demanding his rights, While a young widowed mother must work for her kids, and spend alone many long nights. The beat that he walked was a battlefield too, just as if he’d gone off to war. Though the flag of our nation won’t fly at half mast, to his name they will add a gold star. Yes, somebody killed a policeman today, It Happened in your town or mine. While we slept in comfort behind our locked doors, a cop put his life on the line. Now his ghost walks a beat on a dark city street, and he stands at each new rookie’s side. He answered the call, and gave us his all, and a part of America died.\n- Deputy Sheriff Harry Koch, Maricopa AZ County Sheriff, Retired\nhttp://www.odmp.org/year.php\nhttp://www.odmp.org/\nhttp://www.policeone.com/officer-shootings/\nhttp://www.nleomf.com/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\nhttp://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2011/0323/Is-there-a-war-on-cops-Eric-Holder-vows-action-as-police-fears-rise.\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/03/25/justice-department-alarmed-rising-number-police-deaths/\nhttp://goforward.bm23.com/public/?q=preview_message&fn=Link&t=1&ssid=10534&id=6qpwovojvk66jvfpi05sf0id8wjz5&id2=706d1xuz7zbez2ojccdr142tl19eo&subscriber_id=afdsbsycqmyafeauubjfvygnlzstbeo&messageversion_id=afjlychppcngudphfmxnzaanlheubje&delivery_id=apsuufggtcjvinmibcomyepipxtybmo&tid=3.KSY.Bot4Zw.CDEw.Jfu5..No61.b..l.AtcB.b.TbYSJQ.TbYSJQ.RpTPGA\nhttp://nypd.police-memorial.com/Copyright TBC 2011 © All Rights Reserved\nLabels: Current events, Editorial Comment, Law Enforcement Community Deaths, Line of Duty Deaths, News Comment, Social Commentary\nTHE NFL AND THE HAZARDS OF AN ELITE PROFESSION\nTWO OF THE HARDEST HITTING TEAMS WILL SQUARE OFF CAPPING THE \"SEASON OF THE HEAD INJURY\n(Saturday, February 5, 2011.

This years version of the Super Bowl will showcase two of the most storied franchises in NFL history and two of the most evenly matched teams in recent years.\nFor two weeks now members of each organization have spent countless hours involved in photo ops, endless interviews and press scrutiny usually reserved for Presidential candidates on election eve.\nThe story lines coming out of each camp have been as diverse if not disparate as any however, due to the unusual attention this past season has invited regarding the safety of the players (particularly head-to-head contact and concussions), the short and long term affects of playing such a violent game, a great deal of the focus has been on these rather sensitive issues rather than the usual X’s and O’s of the contest itself. Some of the NFL’s biggest “hitters” will take the field. Both of the quarterbacks who will be leading their respective offensives tomorrow have suffered head injuries and concussions over the course of their careers. The signal caller for the Packers, Aaron Rogers will be wearing, for the fourth consecutive game, a specially modified helmet to protect him from sustaining yet another concussion; he missed several games this year as a result of not being able to pass the newly implemented “post concussive” medical examinations developed by the medical consultants to the NFL.\nAny boy who has ever put on a pair of shoulder pads and the rest of the standard equipment required to play football on every level, has, at one time or another, dreamed of playing at “the next level.” High schoolers want to play big time collegiate ball while those fortunate, talented and physically gifted enough to play the college game on the highest level all inevitably desire the money, fame, fortune, glory and sense of competition, of being among the small elite fraternity of NFLers playing this immensely popular sport professionally. Few, at any time in their playing days; be they in high school, college or on the professional level, give serious consideration to the potential for sustaining acute, chronic and / or life altering physical and neurologic injuries that may result in varying degrees of impairment once their playing days are over.\nIf the sense of indestructibility is common among young men it is taken to an entirely uniquely lofty apex among the men playing in the NFL considered to be among the best athletes in the world, bar none. Even as evidence mounts correlating certain forms of degenerative brain disease from the thousands of “sub-concussive collisions” a football player encounters from the time he first straps on a helmet, to the well known potential of life long chronic musculo-skelatal problems, arthritis, chronic pain and a list of symptoms, syndromes, diseases and disabilities that is far too long to list here, one would be hard pressed to find a football player, particularly an NFLer prepared to walk away from the sport that defines him or has become his chosen profession.\nThe harsh facts of life are that less than 99.9% of boys who play college football will never even have a remote chance of playing football professionally. Those who manage to actually graduate from college with a degree may have opportunities to make a comfortable living and carve out a decent life for themselves and their families without football.\nThus far no professional football player has received a fatal injury on the job.\nThe professions listed above, however, are well represented among the most dangerous jobs in America.\nAll the rest, whether or not they ever played a down in a college football game will go on into the workforce just as their peers who never strapped on a football helmet. But, many men do indeed put helmets on everyday they go to work. They may be men who walk high steel, coal miners, firefighters, construction workers and tradesmen, welders or sandhogs. Most won’t wear helmets of any kind as they earn their livings in every type of blue collar job there is; some, far more hazardous on a daily basis than any minute on a football field.\nThe average salary for an NFL player this season is $1.8 million - quite an “average” income for any profession. That average salary is at least three times higher than the average salary for those who work in professions with far greater instances and potentialities of injury and even death. Commercial fisherman, truck drivers, ranch laborers, garbage men, cops, highway road crew workers, high voltage electrical repair and installation workers - these are the workers, toiling for annual wages that range from the mid $30,000 range up to the high end of their neighborhoods near $88,000. The statisticians and labor demographers out there can argue the ratio of and per capita representation of all the other hazardous professions in America compared to the small number of professional football players and still not have a valid argument when it comes to risks and rewards. Indeed, this year their were 1,696 men playing in the NFL.\nHAZARDS, CHOICES, MONEY\nEnough has already been made about how we as a society, a culture put our athletes on pedestals from the first time they show any real promise. Everyone who has been in High School recalls that the athletes, the members of this or that team had been treated differently, “specially” in comparison to their non-athletic classmates. In college, especially in the big, major conference universities where head football coaches salaries are measured in the millions of dollars, this coddling and special treatment of athletes is taken to an entirely new plane of apartnessness, privilege, uniqueness and entitlement. That is not the argument here.\nWhat is at the heart of this discussion and the disingenuous “concern” expressed by the NFL hierarchy regarding players safety and health as well as their long term medical problems, is that this elite group of 1, 696 men have made their choice. They have chosen to follow their dream, some one else’s dreams for them, the money and all that attaches to them as professional football players. Money is no small motivator and the promise of ever increasing sums of money in higher salaries, incentives and endorsements in the present tense certainly obscure whatever risks they may be taking as well as the chance they might end up seriously impaired after their careers end.\nCareers end quickly in the NFL, sometimes in the blink of an eye. The specter of a wrong turn or cut, a twisted knee with torn ligaments and cartilage, broken, dislocated bones, degenerative structural ailments of all kinds roam the sidelines of every game as phantom menaces not to be seen, thought of or acknowledged in any way.\nCareers and sometimes lives end in similar nanoseconds for underground miners, law enforcement officers, oil rig workers and others. Many professions carry with them a deadly legacy by way of the various toxic and carcinogenic exposures workers incurred while on they way to a pension.\nTHERE ARE REAL CONCERNS BUT...\nThe last few years has seen a massive amount of data assembled from research and medical surveillance programs that track the health and well being of men who have retired from the NFL. The conclusions drawn from much of this data regarding the long lasting affects of repetitive head trauma alone is sobering. Tissue samples examined microscopically from brains donated by the families of retired NFLers show neuropathological changes in their brains suggestive of the same type of degenerative processes seen as markers for Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease.\nOther long term medical surveillance programs have tracked lung disease in miners, factory workers from a wide range of industries, and a veritable medical encyclopedia of ailments many of which will prove to be fatal for some of those affected. Many professions in this country are hazardous on a daily basis and still others bring with them the possibility of chronic conditions that will alter the quality of life long after their workers have punched the clock at the end of their last shift.\nTomorrows game will go on as scheduled and each man that takes the field will, no doubt, look back when questioned sometime years from now as his Super Bowl experience as one of the highlights of his life. Many of the former NFLers who have been interviewed admit that the quality of their day to day life is a direct result of the years they played football. They all cite examples back to junior league and their high school careers when they sustained injuries, sometimes severe concussions, yet chose to “walk it off” and get back in the action. Imposing fines and penalties will not alter the way the current NFL players play the game.\nAs Drew Breese last seasons Super Bowl winning quarterback of the New Orleans Saints noted on ESPN earlier this week, the “improved equipment meant to protect the players’ has actually made the players “more” dangerous, more lethal. The NFL stresses player safety but everyone involved in the game on any level and certainly all those even on the periphery realize that money is the bottom line, the only bottom line that counts. As long as the NFL produces a product - highly competitive football played by the world’s greatest athletes - there will continue to be violent collisions, injuries and long term repercussions for these men when they ultimately leave the game.\nThe same can be said for so many hundreds of thousands of American workers from every corner of the workforce, every sector of the giant apparatus that is American production, industry, manufacturing, construction, transportation and distribution. According to the Occupational safety and Health Administration (OSHA), everyday 16 men and women who punched a clock in the morning did not return home from work as the result of a workplace injury or death. That is reality.\nTAGS: NFL, NFL Player Safety, Concussions, OSHA, Football, Risks, Rewards, NFL Head Injury Advisory Committee, Super Bowl.\nhttp://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/the-most-dangerous-jobs-in-america/\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/the-15-most-dangerous-jobs-in-america-2010-3#no-15-grounds-maintenance-workers-1\nhttp://www.myoshaadvisor.info/2010/08/does-osha-have-jurisdiction-over-the-nfl/\nhttp://cashmoneylife.com/most-dangerous-jobs/\nhttp://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/11/nfl-injury-rate-has-actually-decreased-since-last-year/1\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_issues_in_American_football\nhttp://www.wharz.com/nfl-injury-rate-hasnt-increased/\nOriginally posted on BroodingCynyx.blogspot.com & zimbio.com/The+Brooding+Cynyx Saturday, February 5, 2011 @ 12:30PM EST\nPosted by Brooding Cynyc at 12:30 PM No comments:\nLabels: Current events, Editorial Comment, Sports Commentary\nAND SO DO MANY OTHER PEOPLE\nAntigovernment protesters clash with regime backed thugs\nTahrir Square on Wednesday.\n(February 3, 2011. Washington, DC) Dawn broke on Cairo, Egypt hours ago after yesterdays violence raged on through the night between the antigovernment protesters and “bands of armed thugs” allegedly doing the dirty work for the embattled President Mubarak as his Army has apparently taken a neutral position amid the escalating tension and violence. It appears that Egyptians have had enough of the 30 year reign of the oppressive Mubarak regime. The last 30 years has seen the 80 million plus population of one of the oldest civilizations on the planet struggle with 40% unemployment, poverty, human rights violations and a host of societal ills that has spawned everything from high infant mortality to the radical Muslim Brotherhood.\nIt is difficult to witness the live footage airing since earlier yesterday on MSNBC of the scenes in Cairo without hearing the words that Thomas Jefferson wrote in our own Declaration of Independence in 1776. The “self evident” truths that motivated our own struggle to be free of the tyranny of the British Empire resounds with millions and millions of people today living under varying degrees of modern day tyranny and rigid, strong-armed regimes deaf to the plight and problems plaguing their own citizenry.\nYesterday saw the widest scale escalation of violence as armed marauding bands of Mubarak’s “Secret Police” and other factions loyal to and paid by the 82 year old President went on the offensive against the huge crowds that have been gathered in and around Tahrir Square within stands the Egyptian National Museum. As fires blazed and automatic weapons fired echoed off the ancient streets, tanks of the Egyptian Army stood idle apparently manned by personnel unwilling to engage their fellow countrymen with the armed might at their disposal.\nJust as all Americans since our founding have valued and often died for the noble, inspired concepts that “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness”, the world is standing witness to the latest assertion of these concepts. Contrary to reports from the right-wing media outlets in the United States crassly using the “distinctly secular” uprising in Egypt to somehow promote their own narrow-minded political ideology and label it as a “radical Islamic movement”, the images broadcast via satellite tell a vastly divergent truth. It is a simple truth, a resounding truth and a truth our own freedoms are founded on. The Egyptian people are standing up and bravely proclaiming their desire to join with their global democratic brothers and sisters as they seek Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. It is that simple and, due to the geopolitics of the last 50 years in the Middle East, that complex.\nObviously, America, the Obama Administration, and our incredibly inept “intelligence community” were “caught flat-footed” by the rapidly developing events in Egypt that ultimately may topple the regime of one of our oldest “allies” in that perpetually and perplexingly troubled region. Further complicating this powder keg, Israel, one of Egypt’s neighbors allowed 800 pro Mubarak forces to move into a strategic position in the Sinai Desert. Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 when President Anwar Sadat shook hands over the historic Camp David Accords brokered by then US President Jimmy Carter and Israel's Yihtzak Rabin. Mubarak came to power after Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by factions of his own military incensed by the peace treaty with the “Zionist State.” Since that time Mubarak has been a key US ally in maintaining a “cold peace” with Israel as well as playing a vital yet controversial role in supporting George W, Bush’s “War on Terror.” So, for the Obama Administration and other Middle East nations Egypt and her erupting internal conflict is not an easy matter to assess or intervene.\nYes. This is about as complicated a situation as can be imagined rivaling the byzantine tensions between our “partners and allies” in the Afghanistan-Pakistan-Indian rim. We used Mubarak’s secret Police to aid in the CIA’s “Special renditions” and sent more than a few of those we rounded up on the plains and in the mountains of Afghanistan post September 11, 2001 to Egypt for the sort of special interrogation tactics W. claimed we’d not engage in. Oh yeah, oh yeah. That old wheel is going to turn around once more.\nIt is literally anyone's guess what the Egyptian dusk of tomorrow will bring or not bring.\nNot matter. People the world over hold certain truths to be self evident. Many have died for that just cause and many more will. Hopefully we will not see massive chaos and death live on MSNBC. But, we might.\nTAGS: Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, Thomas Jefferson, Cairo Uprising, The Declaration of Independence, Barak Obama, Secular Protests, Mubarak’s Thugs, Inept CIA, MSNBC, Democracy.\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1353128/Hosni-Mubaraks-camel-warriors-fight-protesters-Cairo.html\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/02/idINIndia-54606120110202\nhttp://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/\nhttp://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/israel-and-palestine/110131/sinai-egypt-israel-mubarak-cairo-jerusalem\nPosted by Brooding Cynyc at 12:03 AM No comments:\nLabels: Current events, Editorial Comment, Intelligence, News Commentary, Political Commentary, Social Commentary, Subjective Observation\nWHY EGYPT MATTERS\nUS SUPPORT HAS BOLSTERED CURRENT REGIME FOR DECADES\nEgyptians protest for sixth day defying government imposed curfews and\nrestrictions. Many Egyptian Army troops appear sympathetic to protesters\n(January 29, 2011 - NY, NY) Last Tuesday night as President Barak Obama, stood before a joint session of Congress and the American people delivering the annual State of the Union address, half a world away one of our oldest “allies” in the Middle East, Egypt, was beginning to feel the rattle and hum of a populace fed up. By today the rattles and hums have exploded into full blown revolt with the very real threat of being able to bring down a government.\nAfter 30 years of tightfisted rule over the largest Muslim Nation in the world and respected by all Muslim countries for their place in world history, President Hosni Mubarak has unleashed his police and military forces to quell the increasingly vocal, unruly and, in some locations, violent protests. It appears that a “tipping point” may have arrived for Egyptian frustration with their government and the social ills that Mubarak has done little to address since becoming President in 1981. He succeeded Anwar Sadat who was assassinated shortly after normalizing relations with Israel in the famous Camp David Peace Accords brokered by then President Jimmy Carter making Egypt the first of Israel’s neighbors to recognize her tight to exist.\nMubarak, a crafty international figure and consummate Washington inside has long enjoyed extremely close relationships with the United States and our Presidents. In some cases the relationships Mubarak used to his advantage were more than diplomatic - they were personal as with the Bush family. On average the United States provides Egypt with almost $2 billion annually in financial and military aid. As with so many other Middle East nations who repress their people, the ruling regimes have been so heavily reliant on the United States that it can be said such regimes would not have lasted this long without the direct aid of the United States. Now, Egyptians seemed poise to oust Mubarak and make an effort towards some form of self determination and a more “democratic” form of governance.\nWhile most Americans would have been hard pressed to locate Tunisia on a map a few weeks ago, it was in that northern African country where a very similar uprising by millions of frustrated Tunisians led to the toppling of the long time regime there. In Middle Eastern nations from Yemen to Syria, Iran and Lebanon, grass roots protests are threatening other US backed, long time regimes. So, what does it all mean? What has this got to do with us?\nThe answers to these questions are not black and white and, at this point in time, extremely difficult to even speculate on due to the fluid nature of the events in Egypt which is the current and perhaps most unstable epicenter of what are secular expressions by long suffering people; the millions upon millions who want unrestricted entry into the 21st century.\nA report released earlier last week noted that the world wide Muslim population is increasing at twice the rate of the non-Muslim world. We already know about the “youth bubble” in Muslim countries where the bulk of their populations are under 30 years of age. These might be ominous signs for the rest of the West and America in particular depending on how the Obama Administration chooses to navigate the roiling waters in an already unstable region of the world that does, whether we like it or not, is vitally important to our national security concerns. The apparent intractability of the Israeli - Palestinian issue has always made the Middle East a powder keg. Now, with the rising tide of discontent and open, hostile rebellion taking on a viral component, President Obama must make some very difficult decisions regarding who are “true” allies are in that region and just how long we can remain “loyal’ to what are essentially American backed leaders who have done nothing to address the endemic ills of their own countries. Despite the billions of US tax payer provided financial support we have thrown into these countries for decades, we are learning the hard way that America’s voice does not carry the clout, moral authority or authenticity it once did. Muslim, the proverbial “Arab Streets” from Cairo to Tunis has no trust that the United States can or will do anything to really support their efforts other than offer hollow, token, tired rhetoric they’ve all heard before.\nThe “global economy” just barely showing some signs of having been resuscitated after the near collapses from 2008 until now is already reacting negatively to the unrest in Egypt. We have been militarily involved in Iraq since 2002, engaged in an escalating, odd and hazardous game of chicken with Iran regarding their nuclear ambitions among other things, and have vocal enemies spread across the region like clusters of chicken pox. Some are state-sanctioned players with terrorism ambitions while others, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Queda and its bastard off shoots enjoy safe havens from Sudan, Yemen and into Iraq. When the US Stock Exchange opens tomorrow look for a tumultuous day as investors find the instability in Egypt generating a ripple effect throughout the already shaky global economy. One way or another, acknowledge it or ignore it, everything is connected. The happenings in Cairo, Egypt will, in some way or another effect the happenings, at least financially as in the price of gas in Cairo, Illinois.\nIn the wake of September 11, 2001, Americans learned the consequences of “blow back”. This is not to imply that the secular unrest in Egypt and elsewhere will once again bring radical elements with terrorist intents to our shores but, there is more than one way to impact a country, there is more than one way to inflict critical wounds on America in this all too connected world.\nHopefully the events in Egypt will bring about some positive, tangible changes for those long suffering 80 million human beings. Hopefully transitioning from brutal semi-dictatorship will not be the result of massive bloodshed. Maybe Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and the vast electronic / cyber landscape will be able to usher in a era of change using the power of social media, thoughts, ideals, words and free expression and take the place of the bullets, bombs, grenades and mortars of the last century. It would be fitting and just if this were to turn out to be so.\nLet us hope, wait and see.\nTAGS: Egypt, Cairo Demonstrations, Secular Uprising, Hosni Mubarek, Muslim Discontent, Tunisia, Middle East Instability, Democratic Aspirations, US Support, Israel - Palestine Conflict, Iraq, Iran, President Obama\nLINKS: (Updated)\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/weekinreview/30cooper.html?hp\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/amb-marc-ginsberg/americas-fragile-arab-dom_b_815058.html\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/world/middleeast/30-egypt.html?hp\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011129153021167916.html\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/01/2011129081571546.html\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/28/whats-going-on-in-egypt_n_815734.html\nLabels: Current events, Editorial Comment, National Security, News Commentary, Political Commentary", "question": {"question": "\nWhat were the experiences of a member of the New York City Fire Department on September 11, 2001?", "questionCategory": "summary", "comprehension": "semantic"}, "answer": "\n\nBased on the text, the member of the New York City Fire Department had the following experiences on September 11, 2001:\n\n1) They were at the scene of the World Trade Center attacks and experienced the destruction firsthand.

{"text": "Integration of HIV and cervical cancer screening perceptions and preferences of communities in Uganda | BMC Women's Health | Full Text\nIntegration of HIV and cervical cancer screening perceptions and preferences of communities in Uganda\nEdward Kumakech1,2,\nSören Andersson1,3,\nHenry Wabinga2 &\nVanja Berggren4\nDespite the fact that HIV-positive women carry an increased risk of developing cervical cancer (CC) in comparison with HIV-negative women, HIV and CC screening programs in many developing countries have remained unintegrated. The objective of this study is to explore perceptions and preferences of community members in Uganda, including women, men, and village health teams, regarding the integration of HIV and CC screening services in a single-visit approach.\nThis qualitative study was conducted in three districts in Uganda. Data were collected through focus group discussions with women and village health teams, and individual interviews with men. Respondents were purposely selected from among those linked to three CC clinics in the three districts. The content analysis method was used to analyze the data.\nThree themes emerged from the data, namely appreciating the benefits of integration, worrying about the challenges of integration, and preferences for integration. The women endorsed the benefits. However, there were worries that integration would prolong the waiting time at the health facility and induce tiredness in both the healthcare providers and the women. There were also fears of being found positive for both HIV and CC and the consequences such as stress, self-isolation, and social conflicts. Participants, particularly the women, considered the challenges of screening integration to be manageable by, for example, taking a day off work to visit the hospital, delegating house chores to other family members, or taking a packed lunch on visiting the hospital.\nThe community members in Uganda perceive the benefits of HIV and CC screening integration to outweigh the challenges, and expect that the challenges can be minimized or managed by the women. Therefore, when considering HIV and CC screening integration, it is important to not only recognize the benefits but also take into consideration the perceived challenges and preferences of community members.\nCervical cancer (CC) is the third commonest cancer among women globally in terms of 5-year prevalence, with an estimated 527,624 new cases and 265,672 deaths in 2012 [1]. Approximately 87% of the CC deaths occurred in less developed countries. In East Africa, CC is the most prevalent cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women [1]. In Uganda the age-standardized incidence rate for CC was estimated at 44.4 per 100,000 women in 2012, which was one of the highest in the world [1].\nHIV/AIDS is also a major cause of morbidity among adults globally, and more so in developing countries. The prevalence of HIV among women aged 15–49 years in Uganda increased from 7.5% in 2005 to 8.3% in 2011 [2]. In terms of burden, between 2007 and 2013 the estimated number of people living with HIV in Uganda increased from 1.2 million to 1.5 million, and 56% of these AIDS sufferers are women aged 15 years and older [2].\nHIV infection has been associated with an increased risk of CC. In fact, an increasing body of literature indicates that HIV-positive women have an increased risk of developing CC in comparison with their HIV-negative counterparts [3-8]. In view these facts, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a more aggressive CC screening and treatment schedule for HIV-positive women than for HIV-negative women [9]. Such scheduling of CC screening according to HIV status of the women implies that women should be screened for HIV within CC programs. Furthermore, HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV), the cause of CC [10,11], are both sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and so share the same risk factors, such as early age at sexual debut, multiple sexual partners, and condom use [12-14]. Taken together, this should provide additional support for the integration of interventions for HIV and CC prevention to include information, education, communication, screening, and treatment in a single-visit approach.\nDespite the aforementioned WHO recommendations and the available avenues for integration, in Uganda and many other developing countries HIV and CC prevention services continue to be implemented as stand-alone programs. For example, a study conducted in Nigeria among HIV-positive women attending post-HIV test counseling indicated that none of the respondents were informed about CC and its screening during the post-test counseling sessions [15]. Similarly, a study conducted in Uganda among healthcare providers (HCPs) and policymakers affirmed that much pessimism exists regarding the feasibility of HIV and CC screening integration [16]. As clinics remain non-integrated, almost all of the HIV care programs in Uganda do not offer CC screening services; hence, women attending HIV clinics miss CC screening opportunities despite the frequent visits they make to the HIV clinics for medical reviews and drug replenishment. Such missed opportunities for CC screening increase women’s risk of presenting late with advanced CC disease and a poor prognosis. Similarly, almost all CC screening programs in Uganda do not offer HIV screening services to women, so that these women risk receiving inappropriate schedules for CC screening. A less aggressive CC screening schedule for HIV-positive women also increases their risk of presenting late with advanced CC and a poor prognosis.\nWith regard to perceptions of the advantages of integration, recent studies concluded that there is a large potential health gain if HIV and CC prevention services are integrated [17,18]. In Zambia, where CC prevention clinics were co-located within the public health clinics offering HIV/AIDS care and treatment, multiple advantages were observed including resource and infrastructure sharing, availability of a wider range of health services for HIV-infected women, and opportunities for referral between the clinic systems and maximization of participation in both programs [19]. Similarly, in Kenya, were CC screening services were integrated into maternal child health (MCH) and family planning (FP) clinics, it was reported that a high proportion of women who visited the MCH-FP clinics for well-baby or FP services also benefited from CC and STI screening and treatment services in a single visit [20]. Moreover, in Nigeria, where women seeking reproductive health (RH) and/or HIV care services were bi-directionally referred to either HIV care or RH clinics co-situated within the same health facility, CC screening was highly accepted, and facilitated early detection and treatment of many cases of cervical pre-cancerous lesions among women [21,22].\nHowever, literature about community members’ perceptions and preferences regarding the integration of HIV and CC screening remains sparse, particularly from Uganda. Diverse viewpoints from community members are critical considerations in developing effective health programs. Since 2010 the Uganda Ministry of Health has recognized the importance of considering the voices of the community members in health programs by establishing and stipulating roles for Village Health Teams (VHTs). According to the Uganda national health sector strategic plan 2010–2015, the responsibilities of the VHTs include, among others, identifying community health needs, mobilizing communities for health interventions, promoting health-seeking behaviors, maintaining registers of members of households and their health, birth, and death, and serving as a link between the community and formal HCPs [23]. By 2011, VHTs had been established in all communities in Uganda, each serving a maximum of 30 households. The selection of VHTs by communities in Uganda and the linkage they facilitate between the community and formal HCPs serves as an indication from the community members that they wish to have their voices heard in Ugandan health issues. The need to include the voices of the community members in health developments was re-echoed in a recent study conducted in Uganda among HCPs and policymakers regarding perceptions of HIV and CC screening integration, in which further studies on the perceptions among community members, especially the women, of HIV and CC screening integration were recommended [16].\nAccordingly, the objective of this study was to explore the perceptions and preferences of community members in Uganda regarding HIV and CC screening integration in a single-visit approach. Information on community members’ perceptions and preferences, if made available, will inform the development of educational materials and employment aids that address misconceptions about integration, which if not confronted can potentially undermine the community members’ acceptability and utilization of the screening services within the integrated program.\nA qualitative design was chosen for this study to allow for exploration of a wide range of views, opinions, and feelings of various members of the community regarding integration of HIV and CC screening services in a single-visit approach [24].\nThe study was conducted in three hospitals situated in three districts in Uganda, namely Kampala, Mbarara, and Ibanda. Each district had only one available CC clinic, located within one hospital of the district. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the participating hospitals and clinics. The participants from the three districts/CC clinics were diverse, providing perspectives from urban, semi-urban, and rural settings of Uganda. Moreover, the study sites provided perspectives from different levels of healthcare in Uganda, namely, the national referral hospital situated in the capital city of Kampala, the regional referral hospital situated in a semi-urban setting, and the district general hospital situated in a rural setting. One of the three participating hospitals was a private health facility while the other two were public health facilities.\nTable 1 Focus group discussions (FGDs) and individual interviews (IDIs) by respondent category\nAt the time of the study, all three participating hospitals had the experience of providing HIV and CC screening services as stand-alone programs for at least 3 years. The CC screening services they provided included health education talks, counseling, CC screening by visual inspection with 5% acetic acid solution, treatment of cervical precancerous lesions using cryotherapy, and referral for CC diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Moreover, none of the three clinics were implementing integrated delivery of HIV and CC screening services. HIV status of the women was therefore established through verbal reports from the women, and those who had never been tested for HIV were mostly presumed and treated as HIV-negative women.\nSelection criteria for study sites\nThe three hospitals were purposely selected to participate in the study. A hospital was eligible for selection if it was situated in any of the three study districts (Kampala, Mbarara, and Ibanda) and had clinics that provided stand-alone HIV and CC screening services. All three selected hospitals had only one CC clinic each, thus negating the need for further sampling within the selected hospital.\nThe study involved three categories of respondents: women, men, and VHTs. These respondent categories reflect the three key members of any given community in Uganda. A VHT is the lowest, and thus the first, level of healthcare structure that operates at the village level (about 30 households). A VHT has no physical infrastructure but a committee comprising a maximum of five lay residents of a given village (of about 30 households) who are democratically selected by their fellow villagers. The VHT formation process is usually moderated by formal HCPs, and prospective members are selected to form the team based on their qualities such as trustworthiness, literacy, and availability and willingness to voluntarily mobilize their communities to take action on health issues. The VHTs from different villages report to, and are hence linked to, the same formal health facility nearest to their villages.\nThe sample for this study consisted of six women’s focus groups, another six VHT focus groups, and 12 men interviewed individually. The demographic characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1. Being a qualitative study, the sample size of six women’s focus groups, six VHT focus groups, and 12 male interviews was determined by data saturation point, i.e., a point at which further sampling does not generate any new concepts or ideas about the phenomenon under investigation.\nStudy field team and procedures\nThe study field team comprised the first author (E.K.), the last author (V.B.), and three clinic-level HCPs (one from each study site). The HCP at each study site assisted in providing the list of women and their male partners and the VHTs attending the clinic, and organizing the venues for the focus groups and interviews. The list of the CC clinic attendees were then used as sampling frames to select participants who fulfilled the eligibility criteria. All of the focus group discussions (FGDs) and individual interviews (IDIs) were conducted by the first and last authors (E.K. and V.B.).\nSampling method for participants\nFrom the list of women, male partners, and VHTs provided by each study site (sampling frame), participants from each study site were selected using a purposive sampling method [25]. Specifically for women’s focus groups and male interviews, the sampling procedure involved grouping the participants by their age, education, and occupation, and selecting from each of these sub-groups. The purposive sampling method allowed for selection of appropriate participants who had ever tested or received both HIV and CC screening services and thus had experience of undergoing both screening procedures. This method also allowed for selection of participants of diverse age, education, and occupation. Regarding VHT focus groups, the VHT’s structure and system whereby different VHTs from different villages are linked to the formal health facility nearest to their communities allowed us to obtain the list of members of VHTs linked to each study site. This list was then used to purposely select VHT members from different villages and gender to form the VHT focus groups for the study.\nEligibility criteria for study respondents\nWomen, male partners, and VHT members were eligible to participate in the study if they were older than 18 years and had ever attended an HIV and/or CC screening clinic.\nParticipants’ recruitment procedure\nThe researchers (E.K. and V.B.) visited each study site to develop a list of eligible participants for each study site (sampling frame). The list was developed from CC screening and treatment attendance registers, and VHT registers maintained by each clinic as a policy.\nBased on the eligibility criteria, across all three study sites a total of 98 participants comprising 45 women, 38 VHTs, and 15 men were invited to the study. The invites were sent by telephone. Of the invitees, 88 accepted, three refused to participate, and seven could not be reached despite attempts to trace them with the help of community leaders. The response rate was therefore equivalent to 89.8%. For those who refused to participate, the two major reasons for refusal were insufficient transport refund provided by the study and lack of time to participate in the study.\nData were collected between February 2013 and January 2014. FGDs and IDIs were used to collect the data depending on the category of the respondents. Focus groups were conducted with women and VHTs, and individual interviews were held with male partners of the women. Focus groups represented an appropriate method for collecting data from the women and VHTs because such discussions can allow diverse feelings, views, and opinions to be gathered within a short time. IDIs were appropriate for collecting data from male partners because this method has greater potential of allowing participants to freely share sensitive personal opinions or views such as beliefs, attitudes, and prejudices, which are more likely to be withheld in focus groups. All of the FGDs and IDIs were conducted by the first and last authors (E.K. and V.B.) in English and then translated into the local dialect (Runyankore), and the participants’ responses were in turn translated into English. All FGDs and IDIs were conducted in a quiet environment outside the CC clinic, and recorded using an audio recording device. A separate sheet of paper (one for each FGD and IDI) was used to record the sociodemographic characteristics of each respondent. Respondents’ names were neither recorded nor written anywhere to ensure confidentiality. The FGDs and IDIs lasted for 90–120 minutes.\nFocus group/interview guide\nThe instrument used for data collection was a semi-structured focus group/interview guide. The guide was specifically developed for the study and had items aimed at eliciting respondents’ feelings, opinions, or views about integrated delivery of HIV and CC screening services to women in a single-visit approach. The items in the guide were constructed based on theory of change and were phrased in such a way to allow respondents to examine and share their perceptions of the four quality control criteria of theory of change, namely plausibility, feasibility, testability, and appropriate scope [26]. In addition, some of the key questions in the focus group/interview guide included: what were the respondent’s impressions of integration of HIV and CC screening services in single-visit approach; what could be the advantages and disadvantages of integration; and how feasible, acceptable, and appropriate would integration be in public and private health sectors in a low-income country such as Uganda.\nData (from the audio recording) were first transcribed verbatim and then analyzed using the content analysis method [27], which allowed for exploration and synthesis of codes, themes, and categories. Figure 1 shows the code list together with the corresponding themes and categories that emerged from the data.\nThemes and subthemes.\nRigor of the research\nThe rigor of this qualitative study was ensured by paying attention to the credibility, trustworthiness, and transferability of the research [27]. The researcher’s prolonged engagement with the data during both the collection and analysis ensured the credibility of the data. To ensure trustworthiness of the study, several categories of respondents were utilized (also known as triangulation of data sources), and two researchers participated in the data collection and analysis (also known as triangulation of researchers) [25]. Furthermore, to ensure transferability of the study, the setting and context were explicitly described (see the Study sites section) [27].\nEthical approval for the study was obtained from Institutional Review Board of the School of Biomedical Sciences, Makerere University College of Health Sciences. Informed consent was obtained from each respondent before inclusion in the study.\nThis paper was prepared in accordance with the RATS guidelines for reporting qualitative studies. RATS stands for relevance of the study question (R), appropriateness of the qualitative method (A), transparency of procedures (T), and soundness of the interpretive approach (S) [28]. This ensures compliance with internationally acceptable standards for reporting qualitative studies.\nThe community members’ perceptions of integration of HIV and CC screening fall under three themes, namely perceived benefits, challenges, and preferences (see Figure 1). Several subthemes, categories, or concepts emerged under each theme.\nPerceived benefits\nAcross respondents’ categories and in all study settings, community members generally viewed integration of HIV and CC screening favorably. The integration attribute mentioned repeatedly in all focus groups and interviews was time saving, in relation to which some explained that it will save time in terms of not making a return journey for the other service, and that it would serve as a huge benefit and motivation for women to be patient and utilize the integrated services in a single visit.\n“It will save us time in terms of making a return journey for the other service”. –Women’s FGD, Kampala.\n“It would save us time because we the women of nowadays are working for our families. Our husbands are no longer responsible. So if we can get a service like this which addresses two issues, then we shall not lose out in terms of time to go and work so that we earn money for a living”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nTransport cost saving\nWhile time saving emerged as a chief benefit for women and VHT focus groups across the study settings, for the men the advantage of an integrated HIV and CC screening was less about time saving than about transport cost saving.\n“Screening for both [HIV and CC] on the same day is very good and women will like it because people come from very far so it will help on paying for transport fares once instead of going and coming back which is double transport”. – Male interviewee, Ibanda.\nProductive use of women’s time at the hospital\nAnother perceived advantage that resonated with many women and VHT focus groups across the study settings was that integrated screening would allow productive use of women’s time at the hospital, which they would otherwise spend anyway traveling between stand-alone clinics.\n“Screening for both HIV and CC on the same day is good and women will like it because we always forgo one day to come to hospital so if we are screened for both it is good because you would have utilized your day well”. – VHT FGD, Ibanda.\nQueuing once\nAcross all study groups and settings, queuing once for both HIV and CC screening was noted as an advantage of the integrated approach. Women’s focus groups especially noted that queuing for one service for many hours only to be referred to another clinic by the HCPs, where one arrives and starts queuing afresh, can be discouraging. Therefore, an integrated approach demanding that women queue once only, however long it may be, is better.\n“What we don’t want is delaying us like yesterday where I spent too much time in the hospital since the women were so many there. So it is better to do everything at the same place or near each other. This makes the process faster”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nWomen’s focus groups frequently remarked that integrated screening would not create the disruption of moving from one clinic to another seeking necessary services. Though mentioned occasionally by VHTs and male respondents, non-disturbance or the possibility to obtain all the screening services from one place was a key concept that emerged from women’s discussions. Women felt that integration could save them from the tiring travel between clinics looking for services, since a one-stop center would be available for all HIV and CC screening-related services, and they valued the convenience of being able to obtain all the services from one place.\n“The integration will be good because it does not require one to move from place to place. Everything is done in one place”. –Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nDiscovery of unsuspected diseases\nVHT focus groups across the study settings frequently remarked that integration of HIV and CC screening services would facilitate HCPs to discover unsuspected diseases in women. Early diagnosis of unsuspected diseases would in turn enable prompt initiation of treatment, leading to better health outcomes. An example of unsuspected diseases mentioned was vaginal Candida infection.\n“The integration is not bad because we have some illnesses that we do not know that we have. Integration will enable healthcare providers to catch and treat them promptly” – VHT FGD, Mbarara.\n“Yes, I also think integration will enable healthcare providers to tell whether a woman is also suffering from other diseases of the private parts (reproductive system) for example Candida”. – VHT FGD, Mbarara.\nBrief or short stress or anxiety about screening\nWomen’s focus groups, particularly those from semi-urban and rural settings, remarked that HIV and CC screening integration would subject women to one-off stress or anxiety about screening, which with good counseling could be easily overcome, in contrast to the repeated stress or anxiety of HIV screening on one day and CC screening on another. In the women’s opinion the one-off stress or anxiety would be short-lived and, hence, advantageous, compared with the extended or prolonged stress or anxiety that would result from stand-alone screening programs.\n“If you know your CC status, you can at the same time know your HIV status and the advantage is that it prevents prolonged anxiety”. – Women’s FGD, Mbarara.\n“When you test for both CC and HIV at once, the stress comes once, and when you are well counseled it’s okay”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nPromotes confidentiality\nWomen’s focus groups frequently mentioned that integrated screening would promote confidentiality of health-related information because it would limit the number of HCP teams working with and accessing the women’s health information. Though not mentioned by VHTs and male respondents, the confinement of both HIV and CC screening information to limited teams of HCPs as a result of the integrated approach was a key concept that emerged from the women’s discussions. The women thought that the integrated screening model would prevent unnecessary access to their health-related information within the health system, and they valued this prospect of confidentiality for fear of stigmatization.\n“It also helps to keep confidentiality because whatever comes out of the screening will be between you and the health workers who performed both screening”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nImproves HIV and CC screening coverage\nWomen’s focus groups and male respondents across the study settings frequently remarked that integrated screening would improve access to and, hence, coverage of both HIV and CC screening among women. The respondents thought that access to screening would be improved if every woman who came to any of the clinics for other health services were screened. Moreover, screening integration would improve HIV and CC screening coverage by bypassing delays in decision making, because women are less likely to waste time seeking additional permission from their male partners for each of the services within the integrated screening program if they find them there on offer after reaching the hospital, thus preventing any delay in decision making on the part of their male partners.\n“It will be good to integrate because even though you have come for another illness, they will take advantage of that and also screen you”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\n“More women will benefit because if the woman leaves home after telling the husband that she is going for an HIV test and comes to understand that there is also screening for cancer, an issue that concerns her then she will also be screened for cervical cancer without necessitating her to ask permission from the husband which might take the man more time to be decided for her to come for the CC screening”. – Male Interviewee, Ibanda.\nGood for women from remote villages\nAcross study settings, women’s focus groups considered that women in remote villages would benefit more from integrated screening. Across study groups and settings, the target group unanimously identified as the best suited for integrated screening was village women, particularly those from remote areas who reside far away from health facilities. The respondents agreed that this particular group is best suited for an integrated screening program because their remoteness from the health facilities and low income level would not allow them to make several visits to distant health facilities for screening services.\n“We the village women will prefer this integration because it saves us on time and transport. Compared to the town women because they are near the services and can access it any time they want or when they are free”. – Women’s FGD, Ibanda.\n“The women in the village will like it more because these women also have their work. They wake up very early in the morning and go to the garden so if it is a one day issue then they will welcome it because they will have to lose only one day and then the other days they resume their work”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nGood for busy working women\nAccording to the VHT focus groups and male interviews, busy working women, regardless of the distance between their residence and the health facilities, were thought to be an appropriate target and would benefit more from an integrated screening program. This view was based on their not having the time to make several journeys to the health facilities for screening services.\n“For my case if I go to the hospital the integration will help me because I have work to attend to and yet I have limited time. Women of now days have work to do. It is not like those days where women were just sited at home”. – VHT FGD, Kampala.\nGood for HIV-positive women\nAcross study groups and settings, it was frequently remarked that HIV-positive women are an appropriate target and would benefit more from the integrated HIV and CC screening strategy. However, this was not based on their knowledge of the science of HIV and CC interactions but rather on their observation that HCPs often urge HIV-positive women to attend CC screening in addition to their HIV/AIDS treatment.\n“Us HIV-positive women who are here right now we are the first to like the idea of integration. Even the health workers told us that it is good to go for the cervical cancer screening and you know your status such that if you don’t have then you are free and if you have it, then they will give you free treatment”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nPerceived challenges\nProlonged waiting time at the hospital\nAcross all study groups and settings, respondents spontaneously expressed concern over potential delay at the health facility as a result of integration. This fear of potential delay was further compounded among some respondents, especially women, who were aware of the fact that the existing stand-alone screening clinics are already crowded, with long queues. The respondents expressed fears that the delay at the health facility will be worsened by the unreliable means of transport for return journeys during evening or night hours, the lack of money to hire accommodation for an overnight stay, and the lack of caregivers for children left at home when staying away overnight.\n“What we don’t want is delaying us like yesterday where I spent too much time in the hospital since the women were so many there”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\n“If the integration will take so long time that even the means of transport that we are to use has left us then we have to sleep over yet we have not planned for such conditions, this will not be good because in most cases you do not have anyone you know in town and at the same time you might have left your children with no one to take care of them”. – Women’s FGD, Mbarara.\nTiring to the HCPs and the women\nA number of respondents across study groups and settings also voiced (unprompted) their specific concern that HIV and CC screening integration would make the HCPs tired, while women in the queue will also become tired from a long waiting time. Boredom will also set in among the women waiting in the queue.\n“It wouldn’t be bad but its tiring on the side of a health worker. The health workers will get tired and will make the clients also tired”. – Women’s FGD, Mbarara.\n“Boredom, if you wait for a long time in the queue”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nStress and social consequences of double positive results\nWomen’s focus groups spontaneously expressed their fears about the stress of discovering that they are double positive, i.e., positive for both HIV and CC at the same time, as a result of the integrated approach. This fear was more frequently expressed among the women from rural areas. Stress was thought to be an unavoidable consequence of the integrated screening. In particular, if the results turn out to be double positive, though not unusual in itself, this can be hazardous to the women as it can lead to automatic disclosure of their health status, marital conflict, violence, divorce, or even murder. Conversely, the fear of stress and the social consequences of double positive results never emerged from the VHT focus groups and male interviews.\n“One is stressed, after knowing I am HIV positive and they again find I am also CC positive, I get stress, after reaching home I am stressed, they would know my problem even if I don’t tell them”. – Women’s FGD, Ibanda.\n“It’s not safe for the women, because after the husband knows that I am positive for both HIV and CC its very bad, he will say I am tired of you. And the husband will start barking at her, some husband may kill you or leave the family and go [divorce]. To avoid that some women fear to go and test, because of fear of how they will share the positive results with the husband and the rest of the family. So the women say even if it’s to die, let us die. We normally see these cases of negative reactions of husbands to positive health status of their women in our communities”. – Women’s FGD, Mbarara.\nMulti-skilled or transdisciplinary team to perform screening for both HIV and CC within the integrated program\nAcross all study settings, it was frequently remarked that women would prefer a multi-skilled or transdisciplinary HCP team to provide both HIV and CC screening within the integrated program. The respondents thought that a multi-skilled or transdisciplinary team would help in saving time, and enable the HCPs to get to know the clients better and provide better treatment. In addition, they remarked that all HCPs are sufficiently qualified to provide both HIV and CC screening.\n“The same HCP team will help in saving time and also the health workers get to know you better”. – Women’s FGD, Mbarara.\nInterspecialty or interdisciplinary team to perform the different screenings for HIV and CC within the integrated program\nAlthough not discussed in the women’s focus groups from rural areas, it emerged particularly from the urban and semi-urban women’s focus groups that women would prefer interspecialty or interdisciplinary HCP teams to provide the different screenings for HIV and CC within the integrated program. The respondents thought that the use of interspecialty or interdisciplinary HCP teams would also help to speed up the screening process. Some remarked that the use of the interspecialty or interdisciplinary HCP teams would allow the different HCPs to practice the discipline of their specialty. Interestingly, it was also thought by some women that the use of interspecialty or interdisciplinary HCP teams to provide the different screenings within the integrated program would prevent one particular HCP from knowing the clients too well, which in the long run would minimize feelings of discomfort and fear of becoming a potential target for stigmatization and discrimination by HCPs in the integrated screening clinic.\n“It is better for different health workers to screen you for the different services because one health workers might know you so much so you might not be comfortable with that one knowing you so much so you would prefer another one to handle the other screening”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\n“Because everyone has his/her specialty which he or she studied so the one screening for cancer should do that and the one screening for HIV should also do his part”. – Women’s FGD, Ibanda.\nSame place or nearby locations to house the integrated screening program\nAcross study settings, it was spontaneously remarked (unprovoked), especially from the women’s focus groups, that they would prefer the same location or places near each other to take part in the integrated program. The respondents thought that this would make the process faster and also minimize the inconvenience of moving from one clinic to another only to join another queue.\n“…. it is better to do everything at the same place or near each other. This makes the process faster”. – Male Interviewee, Mbarara.\n“the problem we get is moving from here to there and after make a line for a service, so if the rooms are close to each other, then one will come from one room and after go to the other room to see the next doctor”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nVillage-level health centers for the integrated screening program\nAcross study settings, it was frequently remarked in the women’s focus groups that women would prefer the integrated screening to be scaled up to the village-level health centers. The respondents thought that the village health centers would help to address the distance and transport challenges, as women can easily reach such centers by foot or bicycle. The respondents also thought that scaling up integrated screening programs to village-level health centers will increase utilization and, hence, coverage of both HIV and CC screening services among women in rural areas and towns to an equal degree.\n“In the health centers that are in the villages. This would help us on issues concerning distance and transport”. – Women’s FGD, Mbarara.\n“At some centers in the villages where one can be in position to even ride a bicycle and access the service”. – Male Interviewee, Ibanda.\n“We would welcome the idea of integration more if they also bring us the services down in the villages and not leaving it in only to the town hospitals”. – Women’s FGD, Ibanda.\nLarge hospitals for the integrated screening program\nAlthough not heard of from the rural women’s focus groups, it was frequently remarked among the urban women’s focus groups that women would prefer large hospitals from which to obtain their integrated screening services. This preference was based on the belief that in the larger hospitals there would be enough rooms to screen many women simultaneously to save time, many HCPs, and the capacity for better management of the program.\n“It needs big hospitals so that there is enough space to examine many people.” – Women’s FGD, Ibanda.\n“These services should be put in the big hospitals because the big hospitals have many health workers who can treat many illnesses.” – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\n“Screening of theses illnesses should be put in the big hospitals because the clinics cannot manage.” – Women’s FGD, Mbarara.\nPublic or government hospitals for the integrated screening program\nAcross study settings, the women’s focus groups spontaneously and frequently remarked that women would prefer public or government hospitals from which to obtain their integrated screening services. This preference was based on the high level of confidence the respondents put on public or government hospitals regarding their respect for people’s right to health and the provision of health services to all regardless of their socioeconomic background, unlike the private hospitals in Uganda.\n“These screenings should be in the government hospitals because ….. in the government hospitals they will work on you as a government person”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nIntegrated screening free of charge\nAcross study settings and groups, women’s focus groups frequently remarked that women would prefer to have access to integrated screening services free of charge. Several reasons were advanced for this, including the fact that CC disease is painless in the early stages so that people are less likely to pay for its screening; poor women would therefore prefer to allocate their little money to curative services rather than preventive services such as integrated screening. Other arguments advanced to explain why the respondents prefer free integrated screening services were the high likelihood that the male partners of women would not give money for screening and that fee for screening plus treatment and transport expenses would make screening very expensive and unaffordable to many women.\n“With this disease (cervical cancer) someone will not be in pain so it will not be easy for someone to get money and pay if they have no pain and she is not bed ridden so if you put a fee on it, then the project will not move well”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\n“Not everyone will use this service if a fee is put to it because if someone does not get sick to the level of being bed ridden, then the person will not mind the screening test. It will be very difficult for people if they put a fee for the service”. – VHT FGD, Kampala.\n“For some women it might be difficult because their husbands cannot give them the 2000 Uganda shillings to go for a test when they are not in pain”. – Male Interviewee, Kampala.\n“If cancer screening is for money then it means that the drugs will also be for money and yet someone has already spent on transport so people will say that they better die because they do not have all that money”. – Women’s FGD, Ibanda.\nMale partner’s involvement\nAcross study settings, women prefer their male partners to be involved in the integrated screening for HIV and CC. However, they expressed a degree of pessimism and some reservations about their male partner’s involvement, perhaps the most critical being the remarks from women’s focus group that the issue of CC does not concern men enough for them to be motivated and get involved. There were also remarks about the incapacity or impossibility for women on their own to convince their male partners to become involved in the screening without the help of HCPs. Some women thought that male partners would not get involved because of other reasons such as lack of education about the issue, mistrust or fear that their wives would be cheating on them, lack of money for transportation, and lack of counseling.\n“For us as ladies we shall like the integration but it does not concern the men. So I don’t think that they will like it because it does not concern them”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\n“It is very hard for a woman to convince her husband to go with her for HIV and cervical cancer screening so the man will not be around”. – Male Interviewee, Ibanda.\n“Some husband will refuse because they mistrust their wives, they would fear that she is lying to go and cheat with their boyfriends”. – Male Interviewee, Kampala.\n“If the men are well counseled and they are told that their wives have to be screened and if found to be having CC, then it can be treatable. The men will have no problem with it actually he will even welcome the idea……since cancer is a disease that scares everyone because it has no rescue”. – VHT FGD, Kampala.\nEducating the community about the integrated screening program\nAcross study settings, women expressed their wish to know beforehand the likely waiting time required to obtain an integrated screening for HIV and CC in a single visit so that they could prepare a packed lunch, acquire money for overnight accommodation if the need were to arise, and arrange house helpers to take care of the children left at home.\n“We are not supposed to be stressed by integration if there were education and counseling. Counseling helps much. There is no anything other thing that can happen if there is counseling”. – Women’s FGD, Mbarara.\nDedicating a full day to the integrated screening program\nAcross study settings, women argued that dedicating a full day to attending the integrated screening clinic would solve the problem of lengthy delay at the clinic. Of course, such a solution can only work for the women after delegating the house chores to other family members and taking leave from work, allowing for waiting time without worry at the clinic.\n“For us the day we set for hospital is taken as a day for hospital and it means I will not go to work and I will also leave all the house hold chores. If I leave home I inform them that I have gone to hospital so they do everything and even though I reach late, I find everything done and I just rest. So we shall like the integration because you have set aside that hospital day so you have to be patient and everything is done on that day that you have set for hospital”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\n“We shall like this new program because when you leave home for hospital it means you have given the hospital the whole day so there is no point of feeling that you are delayed”. – Women’s FGD, Mbarara.\nAcross study settings, it was frequently remarked in the women’s focus groups that women can remain patient in the queue while waiting to receive all of the integrated screening services. This emerged from the women’s groups as another solution to the potential delay at the clinic.\n“You can be patient because you are already there and you have been brought by the problem so you have to solve it so that you can save on your transport coming there for the same service on another day”. – Women’s FGD, Mbarara.\n“We are used to that kind of schedule because when you leave home to go to hospital, the time they release you after they have worked on you that is the time you consider as your departure time so you have to be patient and they work on you”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nComing prepared with packed lunch\nIt was also frequently remarked from the women’s groups that one of the ways of coping with the challenges of integrated screening programs, more especially the issue of long waiting times, is for women to come to the hospital with a packed lunch.\n“If we get to know that it takes the whole day then we shall come when we are prepared in terms of lunch”. – Women’s FGD, Kampala.\nThe respondents, particularly women, perceived the potential of deriving many benefits from the integration of HIV and CC screening in a single-visit approach. The perceived benefits included time saving, transport cost saving, productive use of women’s time at the hospital, convenience of queuing once for both screenings, discovery of unsuspected diseases among women, and improved uptake and coverage of both HIV and CC screening among women. The aforementioned community’s perceived benefits of an integrated screening program for HIV and CC concur with the study by Mwanahamuntu et al. [19] among HCPs and policymakers in Zambia. This study confirms that various categories of respondents in Uganda (i.e., women, men, VHTs, HCPs, and policymakers) had favorable views and were more likely to welcome integration of HIV and CC screening programs.\nUnique to this study was the respondents’ view that an integrated HIV and CC screening program can potentially promote confidentiality of women’s health information. This was probably based on the belief that within an integrated screening program the same or relatively few HCP teams will perform the screening and thus have access to the women’s health information, reducing the likelihood of leakage of health information to uninvolved people within and outside the health system. Despite the lack of literature in relation to this aspect, the respondents’ perceived benefit of confidentiality of health information could be an indication that women who distrust the existing stand-alone screening programs for HIV and CC for reasons of lack of confidentiality and fear of subsequent stigmatization may prefer to attend the integrated screening program.\nThat the respondents in this study expressed fears that screening integration would lead to some women obtaining double positive results, leading to stress and potential marital conflicts as well as other social consequences such as domestic violence, divorce, and murder, warrants some attention. Previous studies have associated HIV-positive results with some of the aforementioned undesirable social consequences [15,29]. Specifically, this finding concurs with a study conducted in Nigeria which found that HIV-positive women who were not willing to undergo CC screening in the future, despite counseling, expressed fear of a cancer diagnosis which they did not wish to add to the already huge burden of HIV they were carrying [15]. Nevertheless, if such undesirable social consequences occur, they are unlikely to be a result of integrated screening but a lack of or ineffective counseling.\nThis study further revealed that there were fears among the respondents that screening integration would worsen the already long waiting time at the health facility, and its consequences such as fatigue and boredom among both the HCPs and women. Long waiting times at health facilities is an old problem in understaffed health systems in developing countries such as Uganda [30], and requires an improvement in staffing levels to absorb the extra load created by integration. Alternatively, the adoption of rapid and batch CC screening technologies such as multiplex HPV DNA testing using CareHPV™ with a self-sampling option can potentially reduce the workload of HCPs in an integrated HIV and CC screening program [31].\nRespondents thought that the challenges associated with screening integration are manageable with means within their reach, such as counseling, community education, male partner involvement, and allocating a full day to the hospital visit to receive the screening after taking a day off work and delegating household chores to other family members. The respondents also thought that the overall benefits of screening integration outweigh the challenges. This finding indicates not only the importance the respondents in low-resource countries such as Uganda attach to an integrated screening program, but also their willingness to do everything possible within their means to access and utilize the services offered. However, being a qualitative study, such favorable perceptions of the integrated HIV and CC screening program expressed by respondents may not necessarily be shared by respondents from other settings in Uganda, but rather warrants pilot testing of integration in various study settings to validate such favorable perceptions.\nThe finding from this study that almost all respondent groups across study settings prefer integrated HIV and CC screening services to be free of charge while others are willing to share the costs warrants some discussion. Theoretically, it is possible for government entities such as the Ministry of Health to offer free integrated screening services if the resources saved from integration such as shared space and labor outweigh the cost of screening. However, in reality this is unknown, as no literature exists regarding this issue. On the other hand, the willingness of some of the respondents to contribute to the cost of integrated HIV and CC screening services could imply that due consideration should be given to the income levels of women when planning financial mechanisms for an integrated HIV and CC screening program.\nIt was also found that the respondents expressed pessimism about male involvement in the integrated screening programs for various reasons such as lack of information and money. Non-involvement of men in integrated HIV and CC screening programs is an issue that is not unique to this study, but an old problem that has plagued other RH programs such as FP [32]. It requires not only community education interventions targeting men but also the adoption of family- or couple-centered healthcare delivery approaches that are attractive to men.\nThe use of focus group and individual interview research methods in this study limits the generalizability of the findings, but being a qualitative study it was not intended to be generalizable [33]. Another limitation concerns the lack of key informant interviews of selected knowledgeable members of the women’s focus group to validate data obtained from the FGDs. This limitation was partly addressed by including VHT focus groups in the sample because members of the VHTs are considered to be knowledgeable members of the community (both women and men) who promote health-related actions at the community level. In view of these limitations, the study findings should be used with caution in unrelated contexts or settings.\nRespondents in the low-resource setting of Uganda have expressed favorable and welcoming opinions about the integration of HIV and CC screening services, based on its economic and social benefits outweighing the likely challenges. In addition, the respondents prefer male involvement and affordable—if not entirely free of charge—integrated HIV and CC screening programs. There is a need for a pilot study of integrated HIV and CC screening at centers in Uganda and other related settings to validate the findings of this study.\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and WHO.

Time-saving: This attribute was mentioned repeatedly in all focus groups and interviews, and was viewed favorably by women, VHTs, and men. It was seen as a huge benefit and motivation for women to utilize the integrated services in a single visit, as it would save time in terms of not making a return journey for the other service.\n2. Transport cost saving: While time saving emerged as a chief benefit for women and VHTs, for the men the advantage of an integrated approach was saving on transport costs, as they would not have to make multiple trips to the clinic.\n3. Integration could lead to better access to services for women and VHTs who live far from the clinic: Integration was seen as an opportunity to reduce barriers to accessing screening services for women and VHTs who live in remote areas.\n4. Integration was viewed as more convenient for women and VHTs who have limited mobility or time constraints: Integration was seen as a way to make accessing services more convenient for women and VHTs who have limited mobility or time constraints.\n5. Integration was viewed as a way to reduce stigma associated with separate HIV and CC services: Integration was seen as a way to reduce stigma associated with separate HIV and CC services, as it would reduce the perception of being tested for only one of the services.\n6. Integration was viewed as a way to improve the quality of services: Integration was seen as a way to improve the quality of services, as it would allow for more comprehensive screening and treatment for women.\n7. Integration was viewed as a way to improve the efficiency of services: Integration was seen as a way to improve the efficiency of services, as it would reduce the time and cost associated with separate HIV and CC services.\n8. Integration was viewed as a way to improve the accessibility of services: Integration was seen as a way to improve the accessibility of services, as it would make it easier for women and VHTs to access the services they need.\n\nThe text does not provide information about negative perceptions or preferences regarding the integration of H", "length": 15398}
{"text": "<!--language: Markdown-->\n---\nid: quick-tour\ntitle: 概要\nsidebar_label: 概要\n---\n\n4D ランゲージを使用して \"Hello, world!\" メッセージを表示するには複数の方法があります。 一番簡単な方法はおそらく、プロジェクトメソッドにコードを1行、次のように書くやり方です:\n\n```4d  \nALERT(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nこのコードは、 \"Hello, World!\" メッセージが表示された、OK ボタンの付いたプラットフォームの標準的なアラートダイアログボックスを開きます。 コードを実行するには、メソッドエディターの左上にある実行ボタンをクリックします:\n\n![alt-text](assets/en/Concepts/helloworld.png)\n\nあるいは、フォーム内のボタンにこのコードを付けた場合、フォームを実行した状態でボタンをクリックすると、その都度アラートメッセージが表示されます。 いずれの方法でも、前述の1行のコードを実行するだけで目的達成です！\n\n\n## 値の代入\n\n変数、フィールド、配列要素などを対象に、データを格納したり、格納したデータを別の対象にコピーしたりすることができます。 変数にデータを格納することを、変数にデータを代入すると言い、代入演算子 (:=) を使っておこないます。 代入演算子はフィールドや配列要素に対してデータを代入する場合にも使います。\n\n```4d\n$MyNumber:=3 // MyNumber 変数に数値の3を代入します\n[Products]Size:=$MyNumber // [Products]Size フィールドに MyNumber 変数の値を代入します\narrDays{2}:=\"Tuesday\" // arrDays 配列の第二要素に文字列 \"Tuesday\" を代入します\nMyVar:=Length(\"Acme\") // MyVar 変数に関数の結果 (数値の4) を代入します\n$myDate:=!2018/01/21! // 日付リテラルを代入します\n$myHour:=?08:12:55? // 時間リテラルを代入します\n```\n\n代入演算 (:=) は必ず他の演算と区別しなければなりません。 代入演算子は、被演算子を組み合わせて新しい一つのものにするのではなく、演算子の右側の式の値を左側の変数やフィールドにコピーします。\n\n**重要:** 代入演算子 (:=) と比較演算子 (=) とを混同しないように注意してください。 (=) とは異なる代入演算子が採用されたのは意図的なことで、他のプログラミング言語で (==) や (===) の使用によって度々起こる間違いを避けるためです。 このような間違いはコンパイラーにとっても発見しにくく、時間を消耗するトラブルシューティングのもとです。\n\n## 変数\n\n4D ランゲージは強い型付けの言語ですが、多くの場合に柔軟性も発揮します。 型指定の変数を作成するには `var` キーワードを使います。 たとえば、日付型の変数を作成するには、次のように書くことができます:\n\n```4d\nvar MyDate : Date \n```\n\n`var` キーワードを使って、定義されているクラス型のオブジェクト変数を宣言することができます。例:\n\n```4d\nvar myPerson : cs.Person \n// Person ユーザークラスの変数\n```\n\n\n推奨はされませんが、変数を使用することで宣言することもでき、必ずしも正式に宣言する必要はありません。 たとえば、今日の日付に30日足した値を格納した変数が欲しい場合、次のように書くことができます:\n\n```4d\nMyOtherDate:=Current date+30\n```\n\n上のコードは \"MyOtherDate に、現在の日付に30日を加算した値を代入します\" という意味です。 この1行で変数が宣言され、変数に (仮の) データ型とデータが割り当てられます。 このように代入によって宣言された変数はデータ型が規定されていないと解釈され、コードの違う行では別のデータ型の値を代入することもでき、その際にはデータ型を動的に変化させます。 `var` によって宣言された変数はデータ型を変化させることはできません。 [コンパイルモード](interpreted.md) においては、その宣言方法にかかわらず、変数のデータ型は変更できません。\n\n## コマンド\n\n4D コマンドとは、処理を実行するために 4D に組み込まれている命令文のことです。 すべての 4D コマンド、たとえば `CREATE RECORD` や `ALERT` などのコマンドはテーマ別に _4D ランゲージリファレンス_ に記載されています。 コマンドに引数を渡す場合は、コマンド名の後の括弧 () に引数を入れ、セミコロン (;) で区切ります。 例:\n\n```4d\nCOPY DOCUMENT(\"folder1\\\\name1\";\"folder2\\\\\" ; \"new\")\n```\n\nコレクションやオブジェクトにコマンドが属している場合、それらは名前付きメソッドであり、ドット記法を用いて使用します。 たとえば:\n\n```4d\n$c:=New collection(1;2;3;4;5)\n$nc:=$c.slice(0;3) //$nc=[1,2,3]  \n\n$lastEmployee:=$employee.last()\n```\n\n4D プラグインや 4D コンポーネントを利用して、4D 開発環境に新しくコマンドを追加することもできます。\n\n4D のユーザーコミュニティーや、サードパーティーデベロッパーによるプラグインが多数存在します。 たとえば, [4d-plugin-pdf-pages](https://github.com/miyako/4d-plugin-pdf-pages) プラグインを macOS で使用した場合は次のコードが書けます:\n\n```4d\nPDF REMOVE PAGE(path;page)\n```\n\n4D SVG はアプリケーションの機能を拡張するユーティリティコンポーネントの一例です:\n\n```4d\n// 図の描画\nsvgRef:=SVG_New\nobjectRef:=SVG_New_arc(svgRef;100;100;90;90;180)\n```\n4D SVG は 4D に含まれています。\n\n## 定数\n\n4D では多くの定義済定数が用意されており、それらの値は名前によってアクセスすることができます。 定義済みの定数によって、より可読性の高いコードを書くことができます。 たとえば、`Read Mode` は定数で、その値は 2 です。\n\n```4d\nvRef:=Open document(\"PassFile\";\"TEXT\";Read Mode) // ドキュメントを読み取り専用モードで開きます\n```\n\n> メソッドエディターにおいて、定義済定数はデフォルトで <u>下線付き</u> で表示されます。\n\n## メソッド\n\n4D が提供するたくさんのビルトインコマンドを使って、独自の **プロジェクトメソッド** を組み立てることができます。 プロジェクトメソッドとはユーザー定義のメソッドで、コマンドや演算子などの要素から成り立ちます。 プロジェクトメソッドは汎用性のあるメソッドですが、そうではない他の種類のメソッドも存在します: オブジェクトメソッド、フォームメソッド、テーブルメソッド (トリガー)、データベースメソッド。\n\nメソッドは、一つ以上のステートメントで構成されます。ステートメントとは、メソッドの1行のことで1つの命令を実行します。 ステートメントは単純な場合もあれば、複雑な場合もあります。\n\nたとえば、次のステートメントは確認ダイアログボックスを表示します:\n\n```4d\nCONFIRM(\"このアカウントを本当に閉じますか？\";\"はい\";\"いいえ\")\n```\n\nメソッドは、テストとループの制御フローの実行を含みます。 `If...Else...End if` および `Case of...Else...End case` の分岐構造が使用できるほか、ループ構造としては `While...End while`、`Repeat...Until`、`For...End for`、そして `For each...End for each` が使用可能です:\n\nテキスト変数 vtSomeText の文字を一つ一つループ処理します:\n\n```4d\nFor($vlChar;1;Length(vtSomeText))\n    // 文字がタブであれば\n    If(Character code(vtSomeText[[$vlChar]])=Tab)\n        // なんらかの処理をします\n    End if\nEnd for\n```\n\nプロジェクトメソッドは他のプロジェクトメソッドを呼び出すことができ、その際に引数を渡すことも可能です。 メソッドに引数を渡す場合は、メソッド名の後の括弧 () に引数を入れ、 セミコロン (;) で区切ります。 引数は受け取り側のメソッドにて、受け取り順に番号が付けられたローカル変数 ($1, $2,...$n) に格納されます。 メソッドの一つの値を戻り値とすることができ、$0 パラメーターを使います。 メソッドを呼び出すには、メソッド名を書きます:\n\n```4d\n$myText:=\"hello\"\n$myText:=Do_Something($myText) // Do_Something メソッドを呼び出します\nALERT($myText) //\"HELLO\"\n\n  // Do_Something メソッドのコードです\n$0:=Uppercase($1)\n```\n\n\n## データタイプ\n\n4D ランゲージで扱うデータにはいくつかの種別があり、これらのデータ種別を \"データタイプ\" と呼びます。 基本のデータタイプ (文字、数値、日付、時間、ブール、ピクチャー、ポインター、配列) と混合型のデータタイプ (BLOB、オブジェクト、コレクション) があります。\n\nデータタイプのうち、文字タイプと数値タイプは、複数の類似するフィールドタイプに対応する点に注意してください。 これらのフィールドにデータが格納されるとき、4D ランゲージはフィールドタイプに合致するデータタイプへとデータを自動的に変換します。 反対に、たとえば整数フィールドのデータを呼び出すと、そのデータは自動的に数値タイプとして扱われます。 つまり、4D ランゲージを使用する際に、類似するフィールドタイプを厳密に区別する必要はありません。\n\nしかし、プログラミングにおいて異なるデータタイプを混同しないようにすることは重要です。 \"ABC\" を日付フィールドに格納しても意味がないように、日付型の変数に \"ABC\" を格納することも意味がありません。 4D は、コードに書かれたことをできるだけ有効にしようとします。 たとえば、日付に数値を加算した場合は、日付に日数を加算したいものと認識します。しかし、日付に文字列を加算した場合には、4D はその操作が意味を持たないことを警告します。\n\nあるタイプとして格納したデータを、別のタイプとして使用する場合があります。 4D ランゲージには、データタイプを変換するためのコマンドが用意されています。 たとえば、数値で始まり、\"abc\" 等の文字で終了する部品番号を作成する場合、 以下のように記述することができます:\n\n```4d\n[Products]Part_Number:=String(Number)+\"abc\"\n```\n\n数値変数 _Number_ の値が17であれば、_[Products]Part_Number_ に \"17abc\" という文字列が代入されます。\n\nデータタイプについては [データタイプ](Concepts/data-types.md) の節で詳しく説明しています。\n\n## オブジェクトとコレクション\n\n4D ランゲージのオブジェクトとコレクションは、オブジェクト記法を使用して値を代入・取得することができます。 たとえば:\n\n```4d\nemployee.name:=\"Smith\"\n```\n\n大カッコ内と文字列の組み合わせを用いることもできます:\n\n```4d\n$vName:=employee[\"name\"]\n```\n\nオブジェクトプロパティ値には、オブジェクトやコレクションも設定することが可能です。これらのサブプロパティにアクセスするため、オブジェクト記法では連続した字句を受け入れることができます:\n\n```4d\n$vAge:=employee.children[2].age\n```\n\nオブジェクトのプロパティ値が、メソッド (フォーミュラ) をカプセル化したオブジェクトである場合には、プロパティ名の後に括弧 ( ) をつけることで実行できます:\n\n```\n$f:=New object\n$f.message:=New formula(ALERT(\"Hello world!\"))\n$f.message() // \"Hello world!\" を表示します\n```\n\nコレクションの要素にアクセスするためには、大カッコでくくった要素番号を渡します:\n\n```4d\nC_COLLECTION(myColl)\nmyColl:=New collection(\"A\";\"B\";1;2;Current time)\nmyColl[3]  // コレクションの4番目の要素にアクセスします (0起点)\n```\n\n## クラス\n\n4D ランゲージではオブジェクトクラスがサポートされています。 \"myClass\" という名称のクラスを作成するには、プロジェクトの Project/Sources/Classes フォルダーに `myClass.4dm` ファイルを追加します。\n\nあるメソッドにおいて、クラスのオブジェクトをインスタンス化するには、*クラスストア* (`cs`) よりユーザークラスを呼び出して、`new()` メンバー関数を使います。 引数を渡すこともできます。\n\n```4d  \n// 4D メソッド内\n$o:=cs.myClass.new() \n```\n\n`myClass` クラスメソッド内では、*methodName* クラスメンバーメソッドを宣言するのに `Function <methodName>` ステートメントを使います。 ほかのメソッドのように、クラスメンバーメソッドは引数を受け取ったり、値を返すことができ、オブジェクトインスタンスとして `This` を使えます。\n\n```4d  \n// myClass.4dm ファイル内\nFunction hello\n  C_TEXT($0)\n  $0:=\"Hello \"+This.who\n```\n\nクラスメンバーメソッドを実行するには、オブジェクトインスタンスのメンバーメソッドに `()` 演算子を使います。\n\n```4d\n$o:=cs.myClass.new()\n$o.who:=\"World\"\n$message:=$o.myClass.hello()  \n//$message: \"Hello World\"\n```\n\n`Class constructor` キーワードを使用してオブジェクトのプロパティを宣言することもできます (任意)。\n\n```4d  \n// Rectangle.4dm ファイル内\nClass constructor\nC_LONGINT($1;$2)\nThis.height:=$1\nThis.width:=$2  \nThis.name:=\"Rectangle\"\n```\n\nクラスはほかのクラスから継承することもできます: `Class extends <ClassName>`。 また、`Super` コマンドを使って、スーパークラスを呼び出すことができます。 たとえば:\n\n```4d  \n// Square.4dm ファイル内\nClass extends Rectangle\n\nClass constructor\nC_LONGINT($1)\n\n  // 親クラスのコンストラクターを呼び出します\n  // 長方形の高さ・幅パラメーターに正方形の一辺の長さを引数として渡します\nSuper($1;$1)\n\nThis.name:=\"Square\"\n```\n\n\n## 演算子\nプログラミング言語を使用する際に、データのみを必要とする場合は非常に稀です。 データを加工、または何らかの目的のために使用することがほとんどです。 そういった計算は演算子を使っておこないます。 一般的に演算子とは、2つのデータをもとに処理をおこない、1つの新しいデータを生成します。 日常的に使用されている演算子も多くあります。 例えば、1 + 2 という式は加算演算子（プラス記号）を使用し、2つの数値を足し合わせて、3という結果を返します。 以下に、よく知られている 4つの演算子を示します。\n\n| 演算子 | 演算子      | 例題           |\n| --- | -------- | ------------ |\n| +   | 加算 (足し算) | 1 + 2 の結果は 3 |\n| –   | 減算 (引き算) | 3 - 2 の結果は 1 |\n| *   | 乗算 (かけ算) | 2 * 3 の結果は 6 |\n| /   | 除算 (割り算) | 6 / 2 の結果は 3 |\n\n数値演算子は、使用可能な演算子のうちの 1種にすぎません。 4Dは、数値・テキスト・日付・ピクチャー等、異なるタイプのデータを扱うために、各データタイプで演算を実行するための演算子を備えています。\n\n対象のデータタイプによって、同じ記号が異なる処理に使用される場合があります。 例えば、データタイプによってプラス記号 (+) は下記のように異なる演算を実行します:\n\n| データタイプ | 演算子      | 例題                                                         |\n| ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 数値     | 加算 (足し算) | 1 + 2 は数値を加算し、結果は 3 です。                                    |\n| String | 連結 (結合)  | \"みなさん\" + \"こんにちは\" は文字を連結 (結合) し、結果は \"みなさんこんにちは\" です。         |\n| 日付と数値  | 日付の加算    |!2006/12/4!  + 20 は、2006年12月4日に 20日を加算し、結果は 2006年12月24日です。 |\n\n\n## 式\n\n式は、値を返します。 4D ランゲージでコードを書く際には、意識していなくても常に式を使用しています。 式は、\"フォーミュラ\" と呼ぶこともあります。\n\nコマンド・演算子・変数・フィールド・オブジェクトプロパティ・コレクション要素等、複数のランゲージの要素を組み合わせて式は構成されます。 式により、ステートメント (メソッドの 1文や 1行) を構成します。 データが必要なとき、式が必要になります。\n\n式が単独で使われることはほとんどありませんが、 単独で使用できる場合がいくつかあります :\n\n- フォーミュラエディター (フォーミュラによるクエリや並べ替えなど)\n- `EXECUTE FORMULA` コマンド\n- フォームオブジェクトやウィジェットのデータソースとして\n- デバッガー内で式の値を確認することができます\n- クイックレポートエディターでカラムにフォーミュラを使用することができます\n\n\n### 式のタイプ\n生成する値のタイプによって、式のタイプを定義することができます。 式のタイプは複数あります。 様々なタイプの式の例を以下に示します。\n\n| 式                           | タイプ         | 説明                                                                             |\n| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| \"こんにちは\"                     | String      | これは文字列定数 \"こんにちは\" です。 文字列定数であることを表すために二重引用符が必要です。                               |\n| \"みなさん\" + \"こんにちは\"            | String      | 2つの文字列 \"みなさん\" と \"こんにちは\" が +

リテラル定数や演算子を使った式は **代入不可の式**で、式に値を代入することはできません。 **代入可能な式** も存在します。 代入演算子の左側に使えるものが、代入可能な式です。 たとえば:\n\n```4d  \n// 変数 $myVar は代入可能です:  \n$myVar:=\"Hello\" // $myVar に \"Hello\" を代入します\n//Form.pageNumber は代入可能です:  \nForm.pageNumber:=10 // Form.pageNumber に 10 を代入します\n//Form.pageTotal-Form.pageNumber は代入不可です:\nForm.pageTotal- Form.pageNumber:=10 // 代入不可のため、エラー\n```\nこのように、リテラル定数ではなくても、演算子を使っている式は代入不可です。 たとえば、`[Person]FirstName+\" \"+[Person]LastName` は代入不可です。\n\n\n## ポインター\n\nポインターは、プログラミングにおいてデータを参照するための高度な方法です。 4D ではテーブル、フィールド、変数、配列、配列要素を参照するためにポインターを使用することができます。\n\n対象へのポインターは、その対象の前にポインター記号 (->) を付けることで取得することができます。反対にポインターから対象を取得するには、ポインター名の後にポインター記号をつけます:\n\n```4d\nMyVar:=\"Hello\"\nMyPointer:=->MyVar\nALERT(MyPointer->)\n```\n\n## コメント\n\nコメントとは、コード内の実行されないテキストのことです。 これらのテキストは、コード実行時にインタープリターによって無視されます。\n\nコメントの書き方は2通りあります:\n\n- `//` 記号の後はすべてコメントとして扱われるため、これを使って1行のコメントが書けます\n- `/*コメント*/` の表記方法でインラインコメント、または複数行にまたがるコメントが書けます\n\nこれらの書き方は同時に使用できます。\n\n#### シングルラインコメント (//)\n\nコードの後や行の最初に `//` を使うと、その後のテキストはすべてコメントとなります。 例:\n\n```4d\n// これはコメントです\nFor($vCounter;1;100) // ループを開始します\n  // コメント\n  // コメント\n  // コメント\n End for\n```\n\n####

{"text": "Àptera\nÀptera () és una antiga ciutat de Creta, actualment en ruïnes, situada en la unitat perifèrica de Khanià. Àptera fou fundada sobre el pujol de Paliokastro, a una altitud de 230 m, dominant la badia de Suda i estava a 15 km a l'est de l'actual Khanià.\n\nA part de l'esment de Pausànies sobre els arquers d'Áptera que ajudaren els lacedemonis en la Segona Guerra messènica (), no hi ha referències històriques i polítiques sobre les seues institucions fins a començaments del període hel·lenístic.\n\nDocumentada en tauletes micèniques amb la forma a-pa-ta-wa i després refundada al s. VIII ae, arribà al seu apogeu en el període hel·lenístic. Gaudia d'una posició estratègica a la badia de Suda, amb dos ports: Minoa (actual Marathi) i Císam (prop de l'actual Kalives).\n\nÁptera continuà sent una ciutat important en època romana i durant els primers temps de l'Imperi Romà d'Orient, abans de ser destruïda per dos terratrèmols al s. IV i VII, i pels sarraïns al 823.\n\nEls venecians llavors construïren un fort en l'emplaçament de la ciutat. Fou destruïda pels pirates el 1583. La posició estratègica d'Áptera també l'aprofitaren els otomans, que construïren una fortalesa que domina la badia de Suda, al nord. Les tropes alemanyes ocuparen el conjunt de la ciutat vella durant la Segona Guerra Mundial.\n\nRobert Pashley fou el primer a establir un vincle entre les ruïnes descobertes al pujol de Paliokastro i la ciutat d'Áptera; confirmà aquesta identificació amb les monedes que es trobaren en el jaciment arqueològic. Les excavacions començaren al 1942. Les feren els alemanys que van ocupar l'illa. Altres excavacions se'n dugueren a terme el 1986-1987 i el 1992-1995, i encara no ha estat completament excavada.\n\nTopografia \nminiatura|Kalives i el cap Drápano des d'Áptera\nFou construïda sobre l'actual pujol de Paliokastro, a una altitud de 230 m. El seu emplaçament estratègic és remarcable: domina tota la badia de Suda al nord, La seua privilegiada situació estratègica n'afavorí el desenvolupament, sobretot al s. IV ae. A més, els seus dos ports, Císam (actual Kalives) i Minoa (actual Marathi), per la seua situació a l'entrada de la badia, li asseguraven el control del comerç de la zona.\n\nSegons Claudi Ptolemeu, el seu territori abastaria el de Cidònia, a l'oest, i el de Lappa (actual Argiroupoli), al sud. També esmenta que s'estenia a l'est fins al cap Drápano. El riu Pictos (actual Koiliaris), que naix a Lefka Ori, travessa les planes del sud i de l'est del pujol de la ciutat i desemboca a Kalives, contribuí a la fertilitat de les planes de les actuals ciutats de Stilos i Armeni. Tant en aquestes planes com en llocs més elevats es trobaren restes de finques agrícoles i part de la xarxa viària que connectava Áptera amb les ciutats veïnes. Un mil·liari indica la distància entre Áptera i Císam en el camí que condueix a Lappa; s'hi esmenta l'emperador romà Trajà i dataria del 99 al 100.\n\nLes muralles de la ciutat, amb 3.480 m de perímetre, envolten la part plana del pujol i la seua àrea interior mai fou completament urbanitzada.\n\nHistòria\n\nDes dels orígens fins al període hel·lenístic \nminiatura|Vista del costat oriental de la muralla des del fort Koules, com la vall de Stilos a l'est i els primers contraforts de lefka Ori al fons (sud)\nÁptera està documentada des del període micènic en tauletes de lineal B amb la forma a-pa-ta-wa. Ja que en el lloc on després se situà Áptera en temps històrics s'han trobat escasses restes anteriors al període geomètric tardà, s'ha suggerit que l'Áptera prehistòrica ha d'identificar-se amb les restes trobades al pujol d'Azoires de Stilos.\n\nAl s. IX ae, es donaren a Creta condicions favorables per al desenvolupament de les ciutats, com va ser el cas d'Eleuterna, Lappa, Lictos, Cidònia i Áptera. Aquesta última hauria estat construïda al lloc de Megala Jorafia durant l'anomenat període geomètric, al s. VIII ae, segons les excavacions efectuades en la necròpoli de la ciutat. A la zona hi havia mines que foren explotades des del període minoic. A Mesklá, l'antiga Ceraia, situada a tres o quatre hores de marxa d'Áptera, s'extreia ferro i coure. Però Áptera era coneguda sobretot pels dàctils dels ideans, que segons la llegenda descobriren el foc, el coure i el ferro i l'art de treballar aquests metalls a la regió dels apterans. Els dàctils vivien prop de la muntanya Berecint. En aquesta zona, el 2011 el municipi de Maláxa, situat a uns 10 km per carretera a l'oest d'Áptera, tenia una de les mines més antigues d'Europa.\n\nEl que se sap de la ciutat prové sobretot de les excavacions, perquè n'hi ha poques referències escrites. Pausànies, però, relata que l'any 668 ae, els arquers d'Áptera participaren en la Segona Guerra messènica al costat d'Esparta. Al s. V ae, com el conjunt de les ciutats cretenques, Áptera no va participar en les guerres mèdiques, malgrat no haver trencat relacions comercials amb Atenes, com palesa la ceràmica importada trobada en les excavacions que daten d'aquest període.\nesquerra|miniatura|Vista en direcció nord-est des d'Áptera; a baix Kalives, on se situava Císam, un dels ports de la ciutat\nCom moltes ciutats de Creta, la ciutat prosperà al s. IV ae: incloïa vuit llogarets en els ravals, situats als peus del pujol, a la vall del Stilos. Cèlebre per l'habilitat dels seus arquers, Áptera proporcionà mercenaris a alguns conflictes fora de Creta que hi aportaren riquesa. També hi hagué mercenaris d'Áptera entre els nombrosos pirates de la Mar Egea. L'argent d'Egipte i de Cirenaica permetia a la ciutat encunyar la seua moneda i reforçar així la seua independència econòmica. La major part d'aquestes monedes —se'n coneixen 76 tipus diferents— representen la dea Àrtemis en l'anvers amb la llegenda APTARAION o APTERAION i Pteras al revers. Altres monedes tenien els retrats de Zeus, Apol·lo o Hera en l'anvers, i una torxa, una abella o un arc en el revers. Els arqueòlegs creuen que la població de la ciutat en aquest període era de 20.000 habitants, dels quals una cinquena part eren homes lliures i la resta esclaus. Moltes persones lliures eren comerciants, propietàries de terra o armadors.\n\nÁptera tornà al bàndol espartà contra els macedonis en la Guerra de Cremònides al 267–266 ae. Els conflictes interns pels quals passà Creta al s. III ae, sobretot entre Cnossos i Gortina, feren que Áptera s'aliara quasi sempre amb Cnossos. Després de la destrucció de Licte per Cnossos, durant la Guerra de Licte, al 220 ae, els aliats de Cnossos (Cidònia, Eleuterna i Áptera) foren assetjats pels aliats de Gortina (Lappa i Polirrènia), i per l'exèrcit de Filip V de Macedònia. Áptera acabà unint-se a Gortina, que llavors era la principal ciutat de Creta.\n\nLa intensa activitat d'Áptera en política exterior es veu confirmada en les inscripcions sobre aliances i nomenament de cònsols que la representaren en moltes ciutats, com Cnossos, Ieràpetra i Malia, i també al Peloponès, a l'Egeu, Àsia Menor i a l'Adriàtic. Áptera es trobava entre les trenta ciutats que s'aliaren amb el rei de Pèrgam Èumenes II al 183 ae. La ciutat homenatjà a Àtal II de Pèrgam erigint-li una estàtua de bronze amb la seua efígie.\n\nCultes religiosos \nminiatura|Ruïnes del temple atribuït al culte d'Àrtemis\nEls vestigis de culte més antics descoberts daten del s. VIII ae i del temple atribuït al culte a Àrtemis i Apol·lo. Aquest temple, descobert al 1942, data possiblement del s. V ae. La deïtat principal d'Áptera era Àrtemis. A més d'aquest temple, el retrat de la dea s'ha trobat en dos tipus de monedes d'argent del s. IV ae. Se sap per una inscripció que als s. III i II ae se celebraven curses en el seu honor en el mes de Dictina, una forma arcaica del nom d'Àrtemis a Creta. Hi ha també un esment a un santuari d'Àrtemis en una altra inscripció sobre una aliança amb la ciutat jònica de Teos, a Àsia Menor. Una altra inscripció votiva del 170 ae es refereix a Àrtemis amb el nom d'Ilitia, la dea del naixement. Hi hagué altres déus i dees adorats a Áptera. Els investigadors alemanys hi descobriren un temple dedicat a Dionís i monedes amb els retrats d'Hermes, Zeus i Hestia o Hera.\n\nPeríode romà \nminiatura|Exterior de les cisternes\nDurant la conquesta de Creta per Quint Cecili Metel (67–63 ae), Áptera s'hi rendí sense combatre, com Cidònia. Els romans li imposaren tributs poc elevats. El declivi d'Áptera havia començat abans de la invasió romana, atès que s'havia tornat depenent de Cidònia. El fet que s'hi utilitzessin monedes de Cidònia, fa pensar que Àptera va quedar sota l'autoritat administrativa de la ciutat veïna. Per les excavacions se sap que tingué un nou impuls als segles I i II: s'hi construïren importants infraestructures; les imponents cisternes que la proveïen d'aigua indicaven que la població era nombrosa. Encara que havia perdut importància política i econòmica, la ciutat va veure augmentada la seva producció agrícola, com a conseqüència de la política romana.\n\nLes excavacions mostren que en període romà s'hi continuà adorant diversos déus i s'hi adoptaren nous cultes. Stylianos Alexiou, al 1958, hi descobrí un petit temple del s. I dedicat a Demèter i Persèfone. El culte de Dionís sembla que hi tingué continuïtat, atès que s'hi ha trobat una estàtua del déu d'època romana. En l'anomenada vil·la del Peristil s'hi trobaren estàtues d'Afrodita i Hermes. A la necròpoli es trobaren proves del culte a la dea egípcia Isis. Aquest últim culte s'hi desenvolupà durant el període romà.\n\nDeclivi i destrucció \nminiatura|Icona de Joan de Patmos a la capella del monestir dedicat a aquest sant\nA partir del s. III, Áptera comença a declinar, alhora que les ciutats properes com Císam i Cidònia prosperaven. La decadència s'accentuà amb el terratrèmol del 365, que arrasà algunes ciutats de Creta, de la costa mediterrània del nord-est d'Àfrica, i causà grans estralls i milers de morts a Alexandria. Continuà habitada, com testimonia el geògraf romà d'Orient del s. VI Hierocles. Alguns bisbes del període romà d'Orient nasqueren a Áptera. S'hi van trobar fonaments d'una església cristiana del s. VII o VIII, amb tombes al terra. Un segon sisme produït al s. VII,. i el saqueig per pirates sarraïns l'any 823 marcaren l'abandó de la ciutat pels seus últims habitants.\nEl s. XII es fundà al centre de la ciutat un monestir dedicat a sant Joan de Patmos, el primer esment del qual és de 1182. El cenobi era propietat del monestir de Sant Joan el Teòleg. Al lloc de l'antiga ciutat els venecians construïren una fortalesa, comuna i localment coneguda amb els noms de Paleocastro (o Paliocastro) o Koules. El nucli urbà en fou destruït pels pirates al 1583. El, utilitzaren les ruïnes com a pedrera per construir la fortalesa d'Itzedin, al cim de Kalami, just damunt del peu del pujol d'Áptera, erigida pels turcs al 1872 en honor del fill d'Abdülaziz I i que ara és una presó.\n\nRedescobriment de la ciutat \nDesprés de ser destruïda i abandonada la ciutat caigué en oblit durant segles. El 1415 el geògraf italià Cristòfor Buondelmonti sembla que identificà Minoa, la ciutat del mític rei Minos, a l'emplaçament d'Áptera, en va descriure les cisternes i hi va prendre mides. Domenico Negri cometé el mateix error el 1557. Cornaro, que pensava que Minoa estava situada entre Cidònia i Áptera, l'emplaçà més a l'est del que està en realitat. El 1563 l'arquitecte venecià Francesco Basilicata en descrigué un teatre redó i mosaics, però no identificà el nom de la ciutat.\n\nEl cèlebre botànic francès Joseph Pitton de Tournefort era a Creta el 1700 i visità les ruïnes de Paleocastro. Seguint Estrabó, pensà que Paleocastro era l'emplaçament primigeni d'Áptera i lamentà que la població local haguera oblidat aquesta ciutat antiga. El 1834, el viatger anglés Robert Pashley fou el primer a situar Áptera amb precisió. Trobà monedes al seu lloc amb la llegenda APTE i prop del monestir de Sant Joan el Teòleg, una paret amb un decret de l'antiga ciutat.\nesquerra|miniatura|Ruïnes de termes romanes\nEl 1862 i 1864, l'arqueòleg francès Carle Wescher excavà la ciutat i trobà l'anomenat «mur de les inscripcions», que indicava la ubicació del que podria ser el pritaneu. A la paret hi havia un decret del Senat en què es retia homenatge a Àtal II de Pèrgam. donant-li les gràcies per la seva amabilitat en relació amb la confederació cretenca en general i amb Áptera en particular. El text menciona que la ciutat erigiria una estàtua de bronze que representava Àtal, a peu o a cavall, com era voluntat serva, i que el rei garantiria la seva seguretat personal, tant en temps de pau com en temps de guerra, tant de la ciutat com dels seus ports. El descobriment de Wescher confirmà la hipòtesi per la qual Pashley afirmava que les ruïnes de Paleocastre eren les d'Àptera. El setembre de 1878, també hi estigué Haussollier, que comprovà que el «mur de les inscripcions» era prop del temple bipartit probablement dedicat a Àrtemis. El 1899, quan dos viatgers italians, Luigi Savignoni i Gaetano De Sanctis, visitaren el lloc, el «mur de les inscripcions» havia desaparegut, però el 1928 s'hi descobriren altres tres inscripcions epigràfiques.\n\nDesprés de la batalla de Creta (1941), el lloc fou ocupat per l'exèrcit alemany, a causa de la seua posició estratègica. Fins i tot hui dia es poden veure els nius de metralladores construïts amb pedres trobades al lloc. Durant l'ocupació alemanya, el lloc fou excavat de nou. El temple bipartit es trobà al sud-oest del monestir, que data del s. V o IV ae; s'usà després com a fossa abans de ser cobert per altres edificis en època medieval. El 1958, l'arqueòleg grec Stylianos Alexiou hi feu més excavacions, després d'haver descobert un temple en honor de Demèter i diversos exemplars de cernos (gots d'ofrenes), d'època hel·lenística. Alexiou hi descobrí part d'un tractat entre Cidònia i Áptera i un conjunt de túmuls del s. IV ae que contenien pisa i fermalls d'argent.\n\nUrbanisme i principals monuments\n\nMonuments de l'antiguitat\n\nCisternes i termes romanes \nesquerra|miniatura|Interior d'una de les cisternes\nEls edificis més imponents visibles són les cisternes. Daten d'època romana, i potser les més antigues siguen d'època hel·lenística. La més gran, anomenada \"gamma\" (Γ) per la seua forma, fa 55,8 m de llarg i 25 m d'ample i té una capacitat de 3.050 m³ d'aigua. El sostre, desaparegut, era en volta. Les parets estan reforçades per dins amb una paret de maons i argamassa, i l'estanquitat es garanteix per una gruixuda capa d'algeps impermeable.\n\nLa segona cisterna consta de tres compartiments i sengles voltes. Una part d'aquest complex és excavat en la roca nua. Té una capacitat de 2.900 m³.\n\nL'aigua també era recollida per moltes cisternes en distintes parts de la ciutat, que n'alimentaven les dues principals amb un aqüeducte. Pashley i Perrot van descriure conduccions de terracota enterrades a prop de l'entrada de les cisternes amb un aqüeducte molt petit, de 80 cm de llargada i el mateix d'alçada. Ambdues cisternes principals servien sobretot per proveir les termes romanes.\n\nVil·la del Peristil \nminiatura|Vil·la del Peristil\nUna vil·la romana, anomenada del «Peristil» parcialment excavada, permet conéixer millor l'arquitectura residencial d'Áptera. Datada del període romà del final del s. I ae o inicis del I —aquesta troballa fa suposar que l'estil arquitectònic d'Áptera segueix el del període hel·lenístic de les Illes Egees i d'Àsia Menor: té un peristil interior i un carreró originàriament cobert amb una teulada sustentada per columnes dòriques. A l'atri principal es trobà una petita estàtua d'Afrodita de marbre, un bust d'Hermes provinent d'una estela, monedes i ceràmica d'ús quotidià. La vil·la degué ser arrasada pel terratrèmol que devastà Creta l'any 365. Hi ha un segon atri a la part sud de la casa, on s'han trobat restes d'un pou que utilitzava canalons per replegar aigua de pluja, donada la inexistència de deus al pujol d'Áptera.\n\nTeatre \nEl teatre ocupa una cavitat natural de la part sud-oest. El mal estat actual del teatre es deu a la seua utilització durant el  com a pedrera per a les construccions properes, sobretot de la fortalesa otomana d'Itzedin. Els visitants de començaments d'aquest segle descriuen el teatre en millors condicions que les actuals. La longitud màxima n'és de 55 m i l'orquestra en té 18. Les bancades estaven constituïdes per seients tallats en la roca.\n\nFortificacions \nminiatura|Muralla occidental, d'estil pseudoisòdom\nLa muralla que envoltava Áptera tenia 3.480 m de perímetre, i circumda tota la part plana del cim del pujol on es construí. Data del s. IV ae. Pashley considerà que aquesta part de la muralla seria anterior al període romà. Hi ha notables diferències en l'acabat de diversos llenços de la muralla, amb més atenció a les parts oest i sud-oest, seguint el sistema pseudoisòdom, en què totes les pedres eren tallades amb la mateixa alçada, de manera que les filades eren regulars. En els sectors sud i est a voltes s'usaren simples pedres. En les parts est i nord la muralla és feta amb pedres octogonals semblants a un mur ciclopi, i per això durant molt temps es cregué que aquestes parts de la muralla, de gairebé quatre metres d'alçada i prop de dos metres d'espessor, clarament visibles des de la part inferior del pujol, eren molt més antigues. Pashley les comparà amb les de Tirint (construïdes al segon mil·lenni ae).\n\nNecròpoli \nminiatura|Necròpoli occidental\nÁptera tenia dues necròpolis, una de situada al sud-est i l'altra a l'oest de la ciutat. La primera encara no ha estat excavada, però algunes tombes excavades a la roca s'hi identifiquen fàcilment i totes foren saquejades en el passat: semblen d'època romana. El cementeri occidental es troba al lloc on al  s'establí el llogaret de Pacalona, que segueix creixent. També n'espoliaren moltes tombes.\n\nPashley hi localitzà alguns túmuls amb facilitat i en descriu dos: el primer es va construir per encabir-hi tres cossos, i el segon quatre. Les tombes més antigues, que acrediten la data de fundació de la ciutat, es remunten al període geomètric del s. VIII ae. Els morts es col·locaven generalment dins d'un gran fitós, en una tomba excavada a la roca. A la vora dipositaven les ofrenes, en general ceràmica bastant simple. En períodes posteriors, entre els s. VII i I ae, el tipus més comú de tomba era rectangular, excavada en roca tova i coberta amb un bloc de pedra. També hi ha tombes amb parets i sostre construïts amb blocs gruixuts de pedra (cistes). Hi ha un tercer tipus de tomba, més simple, que consisteix en teules juntes tapant tot el cos, utilitzat per les famílies més modestes.\n\nEn època romana, el tipus més comú de tomba era la cambra funerària excavada a la roca a la qual s'accedia per una escala. L'entrada es tancava amb un bloc de pedra. Es trobà en aquestes tombes ceràmica, llums d'oli, figuretes de fang, joies i monedes; algunes tombes tenen inscripcions amb els noms de les persones soterrades. Les tombes dins de les muralles de la ciutat suggereix que no estava habitada tota l'àrea envoltada per les muralles.\n\nA la necròpoli occidental, hi ha restes d'un heròon (tomba monumental construïda per a un heroi) d'època romana, del s. I o II. Entre dues fileres de tombes es trobaren sis bases d'esteles que formaven un monument commemoratiu. Aquestes esteles amb estàtues s'erigiren en honor de ciutadans d'Áptera, pels serveis prestats a la ciutat. Cinc de les bases tenen inscripcions. La destrucció d'aquest heròon es faria per la construcció propera de tombes cristianes al s. VI.\n\nMonuments més tardans \nHi ha dos edificis construïts a Áptera després del seu abandó, construïts en el perímetre de les muralles de la ciutat antiga.\n\nMonestir de Sant Joan el Teòleg \nFundat al 1182 i dedicat a sant Joan el Teòleg (Agios Joannis), aquest monestir és al centre de la ciutat antiga. Propietat del monestir homònim de Patmos, conservava l'estatut de metochion fins a 1964, quan l'abandonaren. Georges Perot va fer servir el terme hisenda per descriure el monestir Richard Pococke indica que quan passà per Áptera va veure un monestir en ruïnes enmig de la ciutat vella, que seria aquest. Pashley visità el monestir al segle següent, i digué que al 1833 els monjos tenien oliveres a l'entorn de l'edifici, que havia estat abandonat en gran part des de l'inici dels combats de la Guerra d'independència de Grècia del 1822. Thomas Spratt en comentava que els monjos compartien tasques amb camperols de la zona i parlà de les dificultats dels religiosos lluitant contra el robatori de blat i bestiar comés pels habitants d'Apocoronas i Sfakia.\n\nEls monjos donaren a Pashley les monedes que havien trobat a terra al voltant del monestir, i amb això pogué relacionar les ruïnes amb la ciutat d'Áptera. Els viatgers també esmenten mosaics en la ubicació de la capella del monestir actual, la qual cosa seria la prova de l'existència d'una basílica cristiana més antiga. El monestir, actualment abandonat pels monjos, és utilitzat pels equips d'arqueòlegs que treballen al jaciment. Una sala acull una exposició sobre la història, l'arquitectura i les excavacions empreses al lloc.\n\nFortalesa turca \nminiatura|La fortalesa turca de Koules i el vessant nord (enfront del mar) del pujol d'Áptera, amb el massís Lefka Ori al fons\nA l'extrem nord-est de l'espai delimitat per les muralles s'alça la fortalesa construïda pels venecians al s. XVI i destruïda pels pirates el 1583. Quan visità Creta al s. XVIII, Richard Pococke descrigué les ruïnes d'una torre semicircular. Les ruïnes d'aquesta fortalesa encara eren visibles quan Spratt visità el lloc en la dècada de 1850, però Spratt pensava que eren d'època romana o medieval. L'edifici fou restaurat pels otomans el 1866-1867, durant la revolta cretenca i té el nom de Koules. La construïren usant en part els materials recollits en les ruïnes de l'antiga ciutat. L'edifici és de forma quasi rectangular, 35 per 25 m, i té dues torres a la façana sud. La façana nord descriu un arc de cercle. La fortalesa domina la badia de Suda i la vall d'Apocóronas cap a Kalives i Vamos, fins a la fortalesa Itzedin construïda pels turcs més a baix uns anys més tard. El 2013, el Ministeri de Cultura de Grècia projectà la reconstrucció del fort Koules d'Áptera.\n\nNotes\n\nReferències\n\nBibliografia\n\nObres modernes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n+Ministeri de Cultura i Esports de Grècia (ed.\n\nObres antigues i relats de viatges\n\nEnllaços externs \n\n Inscripcions de l'antigua Áptera.\n\nCategoria:Ciutats antigues de Creta\nCategoria:Jaciments arqueològics de Creta\nCategoria:Història de Creta", "question": {"question": "\nWhat was the strategic position of the ancient city of Aptera?", "questionCategory": "summary", "comprehension": "semantic"}, "answer": "\n\nUnfortunately, the text does not contain information about the strategic position of the ancient city of Aptera.

年）》，以习近平新时\n代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，全面贯彻党的十九大、中央城市工\n作会议和中央城镇化工作会议精神。根据《中共中央关于制定国民经\n济和社会发展第十四个五年规划的建议》、\n《江西省国民经济和社会发\n展第十四个五年规划和二〇三五年远景目标纲要》、《江西省 2020 年\n新型城镇化建设和城乡融合发展重点任务》、\n《宜春市国民经济和社会\n发展第十四个五年规划和二Ο三五年远景目标纲要》编制。本规划突\n出“新型城镇化的核心是人的城镇化”、“可持续的新型城镇化发展”\n等关键性问题，主要阐明宜春市新型城镇化的指导思想、主要原则和\n发展目标，明确未来城镇化的发展路径、主要目标和战略任务，是指\n导今后一个时期全市城镇化发展的宏观性、战略性、基础性规划。 \n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n2 \n \n第一篇  规划背景 \n第一章 发展态势 \n一、 城镇化进入全面发展阶段 \n城镇化是社会经济发展的必然趋势，是国家现代化的重要标志。\n改革开放 40 年来，中国经济发展取得了举世瞩目的伟大成就，经济\n的快速增长提供了大量就业机会，促使农村人口大规模向城镇流动。\n2011 年，全国的城镇化水平首次超过 50%，中国进入了以城镇社会\n为主的新阶段。在城镇化快速发展的同时，也产生了众多问题，面临\n一系列的挑战，转型发展，提升发展质量，成为新时期的重点。 \n中国城镇化进入新阶段。长期以来，农民进城并没有带来身份的\n变化，致使出现了“流动人口”、“农民工”等过渡阶段身份。这表明中\n国城镇化进程中社会转型滞后，半城镇化特征突出。据统计，2020\n年按全国城镇户籍人口计算的城镇化率仅为 45％左右。城镇化社会\n转型的核心就是进城农民的市民化，即进城农民享受城镇户籍人口的\n同等待遇。此外，城乡差异不断加大，农村空心化问题日益突出。加\n快城镇化发展过程中的社会转型，坚持以人为本，促进人的全面发展\n成为新阶段的重点。 \n当前宜春市城镇化正进入发展的“转折口”上，准确研判城镇化发\n展的新特点、新机遇、新趋势，积极应对城镇化面临的风险挑战，有\n利于明确未来宜春市新型城镇化的发展方向、主要目标和战略任务。 \n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n3 \n \n二、 新型城镇化成为国家战略重点 \n2020 年 10 月，党的十九届五中全会审议通过了《中共中央关于\n制定国民经济和社会发展第十四个五年规划的建议》，围绕全面建成\n小康社会这一奋斗目标，会议要推进以人为核心的新型城镇化，实施\n城市更新行动，推进城市生态修复、功能完善工程，统筹城市规划、\n建设、管理，合理确定城市规模、人口密度、空间结构，促进大中小\n城市和小城镇协调发展。强化历史文化保护、塑造城市风貌，加强城\n镇��旧小区改造和社区建设，增强城市防洪排涝能力，建设海绵城市、\n韧性城市。提高城市治理水平，加强特大城市治理中的风险防控。坚\n持房子是用来住的、不是用来炒的定位，租购并举、因城施策，促进\n房地产市场平稳健康发展。有效增加保障性住房供给，完善土地出让\n收入分配机制，探索支持利用集体建设用地按照规划建设租赁住房，\n完善长租房政策，扩大保障性租赁住房供给。深化户籍制度改革，完\n善财政转移支付和城镇新增建设用地规模与农业转移人口市民化挂\n钩政策，强化基本公共服务保障，加快农业转移人口市民化。优化行\n政区划设置，发挥中心城市和城市群带动作用，建设现代化都市圈。\n推进以县城为重要载体的城镇化建设。 \n三、 江西省推进新型城镇化健康发展 \n《江西省 2020 年新型城镇化建设和城乡融合发展重点任务》提\n出以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，全面贯彻党的十九\n大和十九届二中、三中、四中全会及中央经济工作会议精神，全面贯\n彻落实习近平总书记对江西工作提出的新的更高要求，坚持新发展理\n念，加快实施以促进人的城镇化为核心、提高质量为导向的新型城镇\n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n4 \n \n化战略，提高农业转移人口市民化质量，增强南昌大都市圈、赣州省\n城副中心城市等综合承载、资源优化配置能力，推进以县城为重要载\n体的新型城镇化建设，促进大中小城市和小城镇协调发展，提升城市\n治理水平，推进城乡融合发展，实现全省新型城镇化规划圆满收官，\n为全面建成小康社会提供有力支撑。 \n《江西省国民经济和社会发展第十四个五年规划和二〇三五年\n远景目标纲要》提出实施以人为核心、提升质量为导向的新型城镇化\n战略，推进以城市群为主体形态、县城为重要载体的新型城镇化建设，\n打造支撑全省高质量跨越式发展的增长极和动力源。 \n总体来看，当前国内形势已发生一系列变化，城镇化转型发展已\n成为必然，以人为核心的新型城镇化将成为今后的重点。 \n第二章 发展基础 \n“十三五”时期，是我市发展史上极不平凡、极不寻常的五年。在\n以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，市委、市政府团结带领全\n市人民，以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，深入贯彻习\n近平总书记视察江西重要讲话精神，不忘��心、牢记使命，感恩奋进、\n担当实干，有效应对各类风险挑战特别是新冠肺炎疫情的严重冲击，\n“十三五”规划确定的主要目标任务总体实现。 \n——城镇化进程稳步加速，农民市民化进程加快。2015-2019 年，\n全市新增城镇人口 38.44 万人，城镇化率提高 6.4 个百分点。到 2019\n年，全市城镇人口 285.49 万人，常住人口城镇化率 51.22%。其中，\n中心城区城镇人口 64.22 万人，占全市城镇人口 22.49%。围绕农业转\n移人口市民化，全市大力推进基本公共服务均等化，妥善解决农业转\n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n5 \n \n移人口的落户、就业、社保、医疗、住房等问题，推进农业转移人口\n市民化稳步提升。 \n \n图 1 宜春市 2015-2019 年城镇化率 \n——经济基础渐趋扎实，助力城镇化提升。全市地区生产总值由\n2015 年的 1621.02 亿元增加到 2019 年的 2687.57 亿元，年均增长\n16.45%。2019 年第一产业增加值 296.54 亿元，增长 3.0%；第二产业\n增加值 1136.31 亿元，增长 7.7%；第三产业增加值 1254.42 亿元，增\n长 8.9%。三次产业结构调整为 11:42.3:46.7，人均 GDP 达到 48182\n元。 \n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n6 \n \n \n图 2 宜春市 2015-2019 年 GDP 及增长率 \n——城镇化形态趋于优化。推进区域合作，实施“一带一路”、长\n江经济带、原中央苏区振兴发展、赣西转型发展等区域发展战略，支\n持丰城、樟树、高安、靖安、奉新主动融入大南昌都市圈发展。 \n宜万经济走廊建设扎实推进，万载撤县设区工作全面启动，加强\n了袁州区与万载的经济联动。 \n中心城区框架逐渐拉开。在宜阳新区综合服务中心、袁州新区核\n心商务文化区、下埔板块的建设带动下，中心城区用地东向拓展明显，\n有效支撑了东部地区服务能力的提升；在工业新城、三阳工业区的发\n展带动下，新增产业用地向沪昆高速以北集中，老城区沪昆铁路以北\n工业用地也逐渐退出，南城北产的功能分工更加明确。 \n——产城融合步伐加快，城镇产业支撑显著增强。“十三五”以来，\n围绕锂电新能源、生物医药、新材料等高新技术产业，新增省级工程\n技术研究中心 28 个（总数 55 个）、省级重点实验室 2 个（总数 5 个），\n获批省级新型研发机构 2 个；新获批省级企业技术中心 20 家；江西\n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n7 \n \n省锂电新能源产业技术研究院于 2018 年 12 月 26 日经省工信厅批复\n培育建设，江西省建筑陶瓷产业技术研究院于 2019 年 12 月经省工信\n厅批复培育建设；全市认定高新技术企业达到 525 家，列全省第 3 位。\n“十三五”期间，获批丰城国家高新技术产业开发区，高安市、奉新县\n省级高新技术产业园区，高安国家绿色光源高新技术产业化基地，国\n家火炬宜春丰城生物制造特色产业基地、国家火炬宜春袁州锂电新能\n源特色产业基地。信息宜春加快建设。搭建宜春市智慧工业平台，实\n现了全市园区企业、规上企业全覆盖，构建了企业库、园区库、资料\n库、项目库、指标库，打通了省、市、县、园、企在线对接通道，形\n成了实时服务新模式。数字经济加快推进，印发实施《大数据产业发\n展规划》、《宜春市数字经济发展三年行动实施方案》，智慧经济产业\n特色小镇一期已建成面积

141\n家、实际入驻运营 84 家。就业创业不断发展。全市建成和在建的创\n业孵化基地和创业示范街（园）等创业平台共计 20 家，入驻创业实\n体 624 家，吸纳就业 3514 余人，实现了创业带动就业的倍增效应。\n宜春学院大学生创业孵化中心被国家人社部认定为国家级创业孵化\n示范基地；职众创空间被国家科技部认定为国家级众创空间。 \n——城乡公共服务均等化水平显著提高。公共服务设施建设：在\n文化设施方面，基本建成“市有四馆、县有三馆、镇有一站、村有一\n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n8 \n室”四级公共文化设施网络体系。在教育设施方面，截止 2019 年底，\n全市全市现有高等学校 6 所、中等职业学校 23 所、普通高中 42 所、\n普通初中 217 所、小学 804 所、教学点 1040 所，幼儿园 1710 所，学\n前教育全市乡镇和街道实现公办幼儿园全覆盖，九年义务教育巩固率\n达到 96.68%，入学率达到 100%。在医疗设施方面，按照“平战结合，\n医防融合”工作思路，坚持问题导向，紧紧抓住国家应对疫情防控影\n响的重要“窗口期”，针对疫情防控工作中暴露的公共卫生体系短板弱\n项，加快补齐短板，提升医疗救治能��和疾病防制能力，完善我市公\n共卫生治理体系。全市拥有医疗卫生机构（含卫生室）4371 个，其\n中医院 82 个，乡镇卫生院 178 个，社区卫生服务中心 53 个。在养老\n设施方面，推动全市智慧养老服务平台建设，新建农村“党建+乐龄中\n心（幸福食堂）”1269 个，改扩建敬老院 66 所。 \n交通设施：十三五期间，宜春市交通运输业紧抓“一带一路”和脱\n贫攻坚等战略机遇，加快推进综合交通、智慧交通、绿色交通、平安\n交通建设，积极构建立体化、开放式的综合交通运输体系。截止 2020\n年底，在铁路方面，宜春境内已建成运营的铁路有 9 条，分别是沪昆\n高铁、沪昆铁路（浙赣复线）、京九铁路、向莆铁路、昌吉赣客专、\n浩吉铁路、上新铁路、八建铁路、张塘铁路，铁路总里程 656.14 公\n里；在公路方面，全市公路总里程达到 27646.6 公里，比 2015 年底\n（18740 公里）增加约 8906.6 公里，“三纵三横两联”的高速公路网络\n基本形成。三阳至新田绕城高速、宜春至遂川高速已经开工建设；在\n交通枢纽方面，宜春现在拥有宜春站、宜春西站、樟树站、樟树东站、\n丰城站、丰城东站、高安站、上高站、宜丰站、铜鼓站等 10 个铁路\n客货运枢纽，形成一级客运站 3 座、二级客运站 11 座，三级 12 个。\n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n9 \n

\n——城镇化水平较低。2019年宜春市的城镇人口为285.94万人，\n城镇化水平为 51.22%。横向对比来看，宜春城镇化水平低于江西省\n57.14%以及全国 60.60%的水平。2025 年，我市城镇化水平要达到全\n国平均水平面临较大压力。 \n \n图 3 宜春市、江西省及全国城镇化水平变化图 \n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n12 \n \n——土地城镇化快于人口城镇化。截止 2019 年底，全市城镇建\n成区面积接近 373.92 平方公里，城镇人口约为 285.94 万人，人均城\n镇建设用地约 130.77 平方米（合理的城镇建设用地比值约为 100 平\n方米/人），人口城镇化滞后于土地城镇化，一些地方过度依赖土地出\n让和土地抵押融资推进城镇建设，加剧了土地的粗放利用。 \n——城市管理水平不高。一些城镇无序开发，人口集聚不均衡，\n城市景观结构与其自然地理特征不协调，重经济发展、轻环境保护，\n重城市建设、轻城市管理，重地上、轻地下现象比较突出。城市交通\n拥堵、公共服务供给能力不足、城市管理运行效率不高等问题日益明\n显，城中村和城乡接合部等外来人口集聚区人居环境较差。 \n——规划建设特色不明显。一些地方规划科学性不够，未充分兼\n顾环境、交通、配套设施等因素，在建设中盲目贪大求洋、照搬照抄，\n缺乏个性与特色。“建设性破坏”有蔓延趋势，城市的自然和文化遭到\n破坏。一些地方农村“空心化”、“一户多宅”现象比较严重，有的盲目\n模仿城市小区模式建设新农村，导致乡土特色和民俗文化流失。 \n——以异地城镇化为主的人口转移特征明显。由于城镇承载力、\n集聚力不强，导致异地城镇化明显，农村留守儿童、妇女和老人问题\n突出，人力资源存在瓶颈。宜春市统计年鉴及公安部门人口统计资料\n显示，我市 2019 年常住人口城镇化率为 51.22%，户籍人口城镇化率\n为 39.16%，户籍人口城镇化率低于常住人口城镇化率近 12 个百分点，\n存在户籍人口增加，常住人口降低，人口外流严重的现象。大量外出\n务工农民及其随迁家属、失地农民等在教育、就业、医疗卫生、养老、\n保障��住房等方面无法享受与城镇居民同等待遇。 \n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n13 \n \n第四章 发展意义 \n城镇化是伴随工业化发展，非农产业在城镇集聚、农村人口向城\n镇集中的自然历史过程，是人类社会发展的客观趋势，是国家现代化\n的重要标志。按照建设中国特色社会主义五位一体总体布局，顺应发\n展规律，因势利导，趋利避害，积极稳妥扎实有序推进城镇化，对全\n面建成小康社会、加快社会主义现代化建设进程、实现中华民族伟大\n复兴的中国梦，具有重大现实意义和深远历史意义。 \n——城镇化有利于加快科学发展，实现经济提前翻番。我市经济\n总量偏小，2019 年人均 GDP 为 48182 元，低于全省的平均水平。加\n快推进城镇化，有利于带动基础设施建设，增强城镇消费群体和消费\n实力，拉动生活性和生产性服务业蓬勃发展，促进城镇产业分工细化、\n新兴产业崛起和传统产业升级，辐射和带动农村经济发展，实现提前\n翻番新跨越。 \n——城镇化有利于巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果。农业大而不强，农村\n经济发展滞后、农民收入有限等依然是我市面临的主要问题之一。加\n快推进新型城镇化，有利于土地集约化和规模化经营，提高农业现代\n化水平，有效解决“三农”问题，提升以人为本的城镇化质量，从而加\n快全面建设小康进程，让人们生活得更加美好。 \n——城镇化有利于加快城乡一体实现区域协调发展。当前，我市\n城乡发展不平衡、县市发展不平衡的问题比较突出。2019 年，全市\n城镇居民人均可支配收入与农民人均可支配收入之比为 2.13：1。人\n均 GDP 最高的县市与最低的相差 34566 余元。推进新型城镇化，有\n助于形成破解城乡二元结构的体制机制，培育形成一批增长极，优化\n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n14 \n \n城镇空间布局，引导生产要素合理流动和资源高效配置，促进城乡和\n谐发展和共同进步，开创区域协调发展的新格局。 \n——城镇化有利于提升人民群众幸福感，促进社会全面进步。加\n快推进新型城镇化，补短板强弱项，既有利于保障基本民生需求，也\n能有效增加城乡居民收入，是提升人民群众幸福感、获得感、安全感\n的重要途径。新型城镇化有利于推进基本公共服务均等化、构建覆盖\n城乡居民的社会保障体系、维护社会公平正义、消除社会风险隐患，\n也有利于促进人的全面发展和社会和谐进步。 \n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n15 \n \n第二篇  指导思想与发展目标 \n第五章 指导思想与基本原则 \n一、 指导思想 \n高举中国特色社会主义伟大旗帜，深入贯彻党的十九大和十九届\n二中、三中、四中、五中全会精神，坚持以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东\n思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观、习近平新时\n代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，全面贯彻党的基本理论、基本路线、\n基本方略，牢牢把握“五位一体”总体布局和“四个全面”战略布局，坚\n定不移贯彻新发展理念，深入落实习近平总书记考察江西重要讲话精\n神，加快实施以促进人的城镇化为核心、提高质量为导向的新型城镇\n化战略，转变城镇化发展方式，突出抓好在城镇就业的农业转移人口\n落户工作，积极融入大南昌都市圈、新宜萍一体化发展，推进城市精\n细化管理，支持特色小镇有序发展，加快推动城乡融合发展，完善城\n镇化发展体制机制，着力提高城镇化发展质量，积极稳妥、健康有序\n地推进以人为本、四化同步、优化布局、生态文明、传承文化的新型\n城镇化，为建设国际知名的康养文化旅游目的地、国家中部地区战略\n性新兴产业基地、赣湘鄂区域中心城市奠定坚实的基础。 \n二、 基本原则 \n——以人为本，公平共享。以人的城镇化为核心，积极有序推进\n农业转移人口市民化，稳步推动城镇基本公共服务常住人口全覆盖，\n培养农业转移人口市民意识,不断提高人口素质,促进人的全面发展和\n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n16 \n \n社会公平正义，使全体居民共享城镇化发展成果。 \n——优化布局，分区实施。以综合交通运输网络和信息网络为依\n托，以城镇间分工协作为纽带，完善市域城镇空间结构体系，合理控\n制城镇开发边界，优化城市国土空间结构，提高国土空间利用效率。 \n——生态文明，绿色低碳。根据不同城镇资源环境承载力、发展\n基础和潜力，合理确定城镇发展规模，转变城镇化发展方式，提高资\n源利用效率，强化环境保护和生态修复，推动形成绿色低碳的生产生\n活方式，着力打造资源节约型和环境友好型城镇，使生态文明理念全\n面融入城镇化进程。 \n——城乡共荣，产城互动。新型城镇化建设应当坚持共享发展理\n念，努力实现公平正义。实现这一目标的关键在于不断缩小城乡之间\n的发展差���，推动城乡协调发展。新型城镇化建设要改变以“城市为\n中心”和“先城市后乡村”的发展思维，发挥城市的辐射带动作用，推\n动基础设施向农村延伸、公共服务向农村覆盖、现代文明向农村辐射。\n建立健全以城带乡、以工促农的长效机制，加快城乡一体化进程。产\n城一体化也已经成为中国特色城镇化建设中一种广泛认可的模式，依\n托产业集聚区建设，大力实施产城互动、开放带动战略，坚持将新型\n工业化与新型城镇化同步建设，以产城融合引领城乡一体发展。 \n——文化传承，彰显特色。尊重人文历史，保护自然风貌，融入\n现代元素，延续城市历史文脉，发展有历史记忆、宜春特色、民俗风\n貌的美丽城镇，促进自然与人文、现代与传统交融，把城市打造成为\n历史底蕴厚重、时代特色鲜明的人文魅力空间。 \n——市场主导，政府引导。更加尊重市场规律，充分发挥市场配\n置资源的决定性作用，更好地发挥政府作用，切实履行政府制定规划\n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n17 \n \n政策、提供公共服务和营造制度环境的重要职责，促进城镇化发展的\n市场调节与政府调控紧密结合。使城镇化成为市场主导、自然发展的\n过程，成为政府引导、科学发展的过程。 \n——统筹规划，分类指导。按照中央政府、江西省对城镇化的总\n体规划、战略布局和制度安排，统筹推进户籍、土地、公共服务、社\n会保障、财税等体制机制改革与创新，因地制宜、分类指导，循序渐\n进、重点突破，鼓励探索、试点先行，尊重基层首创精神，总结推广\n经验，积极稳妥扎实有序推进新型城镇化。 \n第六章 发展目标 \n——城镇化健康有序发展。城镇化水平持续提高、质量稳步提升，\n到 2025 年常住人口城镇化率力争接近或达到 60%，户籍人口城镇化\n率达到 50%左右，努力实现农业转移人口和其他常住人口在城镇落户，\n基本实现城镇公共服务覆盖全部常住人口。 \n——城镇化布局不断优化。从广域分散、点域分散向交通导向、\n点轴集聚转变；从增量扩张为主的城镇化向内涵质量提升的城镇化转\n变；从城乡分割的城镇化，向城乡融合共生的城镇化转变。 \n——紧凑绿色城市发展模式基本形成。全面推行密度较高、功能\n混用和公交导向的紧凑绿色型开发模式，绿色生产、绿色消费日益成\n为城市经济生活的主流，节能节水产品、节能环保汽车和绿色建筑比\n例大幅提升，城市生产和生活的资源循环利用更加普及，能源资源利\n用效率稳步提高。 \n——城镇生活品质明显提升。实现更加充分更高质量就业，居民\n收入增长和经济增长基本同步，分配结构明显改善，教育、医疗、养\n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n18 \n

\n——产城融合日臻紧密。产业支撑城镇发展能力增强，城镇承载\n产业空间持续优化，实现产业园区和城市新区融合发展。城镇化率和\n工业化率的比值接近全省平均水平。城镇发展和产业集聚、就业转移、\n人口集聚更加协调统一。 \n——城市建设和管理提档升级。宜春建设以建设现代宜居宜业城\n市为引领，高起点高标准规划发展蓝图，让先进的城市建设成为全县\n经济社会发展的助推器。未来宜春要继续推进智慧宜春建设，利用\n5G、物联网等高新技术，并结合已有视频资源，坚持公共基础设施\n集约化、一体化建设，减少重复投资，保持资源高效合理利用，提升\n基础设施运行效率和服务能力，统一构建汇聚融合的数据资源体系，\n实现跨层级、跨地域、跨系统、跨部门、跨业务共享应用，促进城市\n社会治理、产业发展和行业创新，推动城市转型发展，提高城市综合\n服务能力和管理能力。 \n——城镇化体制机制逐步完善。户籍管理、社会保障、住房保障、\n义务教育等方面的制度改革取得实质性进展。城乡土地管理制度改革\n取得突破，进城落户农民承包地和宅基地市场化退出机制基本形成。\n行政区划和金融体制、财税体制、城市建设融资机制、生态环境制度\n等更加完善。 \n \n \n征求意见稿\n宜春市新型城镇化发展规划（2021-2025 年） \n19 \n \n表 2

{"text": "Нарушение слуха\nНарушение слуха — полное (глухота) или частичное (тугоухость) снижение способности обнаруживать и понимать звуки. Нарушением слуха может страдать любой организм, способный воспринимать звук. Звуковые волны различаются по частоте и амплитуде. Потеря способности обнаруживать некоторые (или все) частоты или неспособность различать звуки с низкой амплитудой называются нарушением слуха.\n\nВызывается широким спектром биологических и экологических факторов. Причинами могут быть заболевания внутреннего уха и слухового нерва, воспаление среднего уха или некоторые инфекционные болезни — менингит, грипп и др.; иногда — травма или продолжительное воздействие сильного шума и вибраций.\n\nУ человека нарушение слуха, делающее невозможным восприятие речи, называется глухотой, а более лёгкие степени нарушения слуха, затрудняющие восприятие речи — тугоухостью (нейросенсорной, кондуктивной или смешанного характера). Кроме того, глухота бывает врождённая или приобретённая.\n\nДефекты: громкость, обнаружение частот, распознавание звуков \n\nМинимальная громкость, которую может воспринять индивидуум, называется порогом слышимости. Эту величину можно измерять с помощью поведенческих аудиограмм. Делается запись звуков от самых тихих к более громким различных частот, которые должны вызывать определённую реакцию проверяемого. Также существуют электрофизиологические тесты, результат которых не зависит от поведения испытуемого.\n\nНормальный порог чувствительности для различных частот различается у разных видов животных. Если звуки различной частоты проигрывать с одинаковой амплитудой, то одни будут казаться громкими, другие тихими, а некоторые вообще неслышимыми. В общем случае, при повышении громкости или амплитуды звук становится лучше различимым. Обычно, если животное использует звуки для общения, то частоты, используемые в нём, лучше воспринимаются слуховыми органами, чем остальные. Такая «настройка» существует на многих уровнях слуховой системы, начиная со строения уха и заканчивая нервами и участками мозга, ответственными за обработку звуков.\n\nГоворят, что индивидуум страдает нарушением слуха, если у него ухудшается восприятие тех звуков, которые обычно воспринимаются особями его вида. У людей термин «нарушение слуха» обычно употребляется к тем, кто частично или полностью потерял способность различать звуки на частотах человеческой речи. Степень нарушения определяется по тому, насколько громче по сравнению с нормальным уровнем должен стать звук, чтобы слушатель начал его различать. В случаях глубокой глухоты слушатель не может различить даже самые громкие звуки, издаваемые аудиометром.\n\nЕщё одним параметром, по которому может развиться нарушение слуха, является качество звука. У людей такие нарушения обычно выявляются тестами на распознавание речи (то есть речь должна быть не только услышана, но и понята). Нарушение распознавания звуков отдельно от общего ослабления слуха встречается крайне редко.\n\nКлассификация нарушений слуха \n\nНарушения слуха можно классифицировать по типу, степени и моменту наступления. Также слух может быть нарушен с одной стороны или с обеих сторон.\n\nКондуктивные и нейросенсорные (сенсоневральные) нарушения \n\nКогда структуры наружного или среднего уха перестают правильно передавать звуковой сигнал во внутреннее ухо, возникает кондуктивное снижение слуха. Обычно такой тип тугоухости обратим и может быть скорректирован путём хирургической операции или другими методами. Причинами являются инфекции уха, повреждение уха, например перфорация барабанной перепонки, а также серная пробка. Инфекции уха нередко встречаются у детей, поэтому родителям очень важно регулярно проверять слух и знать признаки тугоухости.\n\nНейросенсорное нарушение слуха происходит из-за потери чувствительности спирального органа улитки внутреннего уха или нарушений в работе слуховых нервов. Такие нарушения могут приводить к тугоухости всех степеней — от лёгкой до тяжёлой — и даже к полной глухоте.\n\nБольшая часть нейросенсорной потери слуха у людей вызвана аномалиями волосковых клеток в кортиевом органе улитки. Иногда встречается нейросенсорная потеря слуха, вызванная нарушениями в VIII черепно-мозговом нерве (преддверно-улитковый нерв) или в отделах мозга, отвечающих за слух. В крайне редких случаях такого типа нарушения слуха страдают только слуховые центры мозга (центральное нарушение слуха). В этом случае человек слышит нормально, но качество звука настолько плохое, что он не в состоянии разобрать человеческую речь.\n\nАномалии волосковых клеток могут быть врождёнными или приобретёнными. Это могут быть как генетические аномалии, так и травмы от интенсивного шума и поражения вследствие инфекционных заболеваний.\n\nНейросенсорная (сенсоневральная) тугоухость возникает, когда внутреннее ухо перестаёт нормально обрабатывать звук. Это вызывается различными причинами, однако самой распространённой является поражение волосковых клеток улитки из-за громкого звука и/или возрастных процессов. Когда волосковые клетки нечувствительны, звуки не передаются нормальным образом на слуховой нерв головного мозга. Сенсоневральная потеря слуха занимает 90 % от всех случаев тугоухости.\n\nНесмотря на то что сенсоневральная тугоухость необратима, можно избежать большего вреда, используя при громком звуке ушные заглушки или слушая музыку на меньшей громкости.\n\nСтепени глухоты и порог слышимости \n\nПорог слышимости — минимальная величина звукового давления, при которой звук данной частоты может быть ещё воспринят ухом человека. Величину порога слышимости принято выражать в децибелах, принимая за нулевой уровень звукового давления 2Н/м2 или 20Н/м2 при частоте 1 кГц (для плоской звуковой волны). Порог слышимости зависит от частоты звука.\n\nВозраст наступления \nсм. раздел #Нарушения до и после развития речи.\n\nОдносторонняя и двусторонняя потеря слуха \nНарушение слуха также может быть на одном ухе и бинауральным, то есть на обоих ушах.\n\nТипы и причины нарушения слуха \nНарушение слуха вызывается различными биологическими и экологическими факторами. Обычно уязвимой частью тела является ухо.\n\nОсобенностью патологий уха является то, что нарушение костной системы уха не даёт полной глухоты за счёт проводимости костей.\n\nДолговременное воздействие шума \nthumb|right|400px|Пример возможного временного ухудшения восприятия звуков после воздействия шума (с. 103). Это обратимое ухудшение — показатель того, что воздействие шума превышает допустимое (у конкретного рабочего с учётом индивидуальной стойкости к шуму его органа слуха). При длительном сильном воздействии шума это показанное ухудшение (повышение — временное смещение порогов (ВСП) восприятия звука) проходит уже не полностью, и у человека постепенно ухудшается слух.\nЛюди, проживающие около аэропортов или оживлённых шоссе, подвергаются постоянному звуковому облучению интенсивностью 65—75 дБ. Если в таких условиях человек вынужден проводить много времени на улице или находиться дома с открытыми окнами, то постепенно у него может развиться ослабление слуха. Это часто происходит при воздействии сильного промышленного шума. Существуют определённые стандарты, в соответствии с которыми устанавливается допустимый уровень шума и риска для здоровья людей. В частности, организация US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency — Агентство по защите окружающей среды Соединённых Штатов Америки) устанавливает порог в 70 дБ при круглосуточном облучении как приемлемый для здоровья (EPA, 1974).\n\n Нарушение слуха от долговременного воздействия шума обычно действует на частотах около 4000 Гц.\n Чем выше уровень шума, тем меньше безопасное время пребывания под его облучением. Обычно это время уменьшается в 2 раза на каждые дополнительные 3 дБ. Иногда для удобства используют не 3, а 5 дБ. Однако это в меньшей степени соответствует современному уровню науки.\n Портативные проигрывающие устройства, такие как iPod (громкость которого может достигать 115 дБ), могут вызывать сильные нарушения слуха.\n\nГенетические нарушения слуха \nСуществуют несиндромальные (изолированные) и синдромальные нарушения слуха.\n\nНесиндромальное нарушение слуха — тугоухость не сопровождаемая другими симптомами, которые передавались бы по наследству. Бывает в 70 % случаев наследственной глухоты.\n\nСиндромальное нарушение слуха — это генетически обусловленное снижение слуха в сочетании с другими признаками или заболеваниями других органов и систем. Бывает в 30 % случаев наследственной глухоты.\nОписаны более 400 различных синдромов в которых одним из признаков является глухота.\n\nНаиболее известные из них:\n\n Синдром Пендреда — тугоухость в сочетании с увеличением щитовидной железы\n Синдром Ушера — комбинированное нарушение слуха и зрения.\n Синдром Ваарденбурга — нарушение слуха и пигментации.\n  — сочетание глухоты и аритмии сердца с увеличением интервала QT.\n\nПо типу наследования нарушения слуха можно разделить на следующие формы:\n Аутосомно-рецессивные (78 %)\n Аутосомно-доминантные (20 %)\n Х-сцепленные (1 %)\n Митохондриальные (1 %)\n\nВ настоящее время известно более 100 генов, мутации в которых приводят к нарушению слуха.\nДля каждой популяции характерны определённые, специфичные для неё мутации.\nПри этом причиной одной трети случаев генетически обусловленного нарушения слуха являются мутации в гене коннексин 26 (GJB2). Среди европеоидной расы наиболее часто встречается мутация 35delG. Около 2 % русских — носители этой мутации.\n\nПотери слуха, вызванные заболеваниями\n\nМедикаментозное нарушение слуха \nНекоторые антибиотики обладают ототоксичностью.\n\nПроводящая потеря слуха \n\nПроводящая потеря слуха возникает, когда внешнее или среднее ухо (или оба сразу) не проводят звук так, как должны это делать. Так как звук может быть воспринят нормально функционирующими ушным каналом, барабанной перепонкой и ушной косточкой, то такое нарушение слуха бывает лишь частичным и вызывает незначительное ухудшение восприятия звуков. Порог слышимости при проблемах с внешним или средним ухом не превышает 55-60 дБ. В общем случае, при проводящей потере слуха распознавание речи не ухудшается при условии достаточно больших значений громкости, чтобы слушатель мог услышать речь.\n\nПроводящая потеря слуха может быть вызвана следующими причинами:\n Непроходимость ушного канала\n Аномалии среднего уха:\n Барабанной перепонки\n Косточек\n\nФизическая травма \n Травмированы могут быть не только анатомические структуры наружного, среднего и внутреннего уха, но и слуховые центры мозга.\n Люди, перенёсшие травму головы особенно подвержены риску потери слуха, временной или постоянной.\n К нарушениям слуха может приводить длительное нахождение рядом с источником слишком громкого звука (больше 90 Дб), например, вблизи самолётного двигателя.\n\nЛечение, адаптация, предотвращение \n назначение медикаментозных средств;\n использование специальных сурдологических и логопедических методик;\n развитие слуха и речи;\n рекомендации психоневролога;\n слухопротезирование.\n\nСлухопротезирование \nthumb|right|\nЛечение тугоухости, вызванной изменениями в звукопроводящем аппарате, проводится достаточно успешно. При поражении звуковоспринимающего аппарата используется комплекс медикаментозных, физиотерапевтических средств.\n\nПри недостаточной эффективности этих мероприятий используется слухопротезирование — подбор слуховых аппаратов, усиливающих звук. Пригодность слухового аппарата оценивается после адаптационного периода, в течение которого пациент привыкает к необычной громкости воспринимаемой речи и различным посторонним шумам. Техническое совершенство аппаратуры и правильность индивидуального подбора определяют эффективность слухопротезирования.\nПациенты с нейросенсорной тугоухостью подлежат диспансерному наблюдению, обеспечению максимальной реабилитацией и, по возможности, трудоустройством. В решении этих вопросов большую роль играет общество глухих. После проведения экспертизы трудоспособности такие пациенты определяются на специальные предприятия или получают рекомендацию по ограничению некоторых видов трудовой деятельности.\n\nРеабилитация детей с нарушением слуха \nВ процессе реабилитации используются индивидуальные и групповые занятия, хоровая декламация с музыкальным сопровождением. В дальнейшем проводятся речевые занятия с помощью усилителей и слуховых аппаратов. Такая работа проводится в специальных детских садах для слабослышащих детей, начиная с 2-3-летнего возраста. В дальнейшем она продолжается в специализированных школах.\nВо многих случаях работа по реабилитации выполняется родителями в условиях естественного речевого общения. Это требует неизменно большего труда и времени, но дает часто хорошие результаты. Но работа эта должна быть совместной с сурдопедагогами и проходить под их наблюдением.\nТаким образом, слагаемые успешной реабилитации слабослышащих следующие:\n Раннее выявление нарушения слуха и раннее начало реабилитационных мероприятий.\n Обеспечение достаточной громкости речевых сигналов.\n Интенсивность и систематический характер слуховой тренировки, составляющей основу процесса реабилитации.\n Естественное речевое окружение ребёнка, постоянно общение с людьми, имеющими нормальный слух и нормальную речь.\n\nНаиболее ценным периодом для реабилитации являются первые три года жизни ребёнка.\nПри тугоухости, возникшей у человека, умеющего говорить, в дальнейшем развиваются расстройства речи в виде монотонности, неритмичности. Кроме того, возникшая тугоухость затрудняет общение с окружающими. Для диагностики снижения слуха у взрослых имеется большое количество способов и тестов. Важной целью этого исследования является выяснение причины развившейся тугоухости — поражение звукопроводящей или звуковоспринимающей системы.\n\nГенная терапия \nАмериканской группе ученых удалось вылечить глухоту у мышей с помощью генной терапии. Более половины случаев врожденной глухоты имеют генетическую причину, и порядка 80 процентов из них обусловлены аутосомно-рецессивными формами глухоты. Ученые отобрали для эксперимента мышей с так называемой глухотой DFNB9, на которую приходится от двух до восьми процентов связанных с генами случаев глухоты у людей. При данной патологии DFNB9 белок, называемый отоферлином, не может выполнять свою обычную функцию передачи звуковой информации. Однако после изменения учеными генома глухих мышей, с помощью специально созданных вирусов, грызуны получили способность слышать почти так же хорошо, как их сородичи, которые родились с нормально функционирующим отоферлином. Ученые предполагают, что данный метод может получить широкое практическое значение.\n\nАдаптация к нарушению слуха\n\nПомощь слабослышащим\n\nЖестовые языки \n\nЖе́стовый язы́к или реже язы́к же́стов — самостоятельный, естественно возникший или искусственно созданный язык, состоящий из комбинации жестов, каждый из которых производится руками в сочетании с мимикой, формой или движением рта и губ, а также в сочетании с положением корпуса тела. Одним из широкораспространённых неправильных представлений о жестовых языках является предположение, что они каким-то образом зависят от словесных (звуковых и письменных) языков или произошли от них, и что эти языки были придуманы слышащими, однако это не так. Кроме того, зачастую за жестовые языки принимается дактилирование букв (которое ��а самом деле используется в жестовых языках в основном для произнесения имён собственных, географических названий, а также специфичных терминов, взятых из словесных языков) и калькированная жестовая речь, используемая слышащими для передачи информации жестами грамматически идентично словесному языку. Однако, на самом деле, жестовые языки практически полностью независимы от словесных и продолжают самостоятельно развиваться: появляются новые жесты, отмирают старые — и чаще всего данная тенденция слабо связана с развитием словесных языков. Количество жестовых языков в отдельно взятой стране никак не коррелирует с количеством распространённых (употребляемых) в ней словесных языков. Даже в пределах одной страны, в которой официально используется несколько словесных языков, для общения между представителями разных этнических групп может применяться единственный (общий) жестовый язык, и наоборот — в некоторых странах с единственным словесным языком могут сосуществовать несколько жестовых. Эти языки в основном используются глухими или слабослышащими людьми с целью коммуникации (общения). Использование жестовых языков людьми без нарушения слуха является вторичным, однако довольно распространено: часто возникает потребность в общении с людьми с нарушениями слуха, являющимися пользователями жестового языка. Люди без нарушения слуха предрасположены к использованию звуковых языков для общения.\n\nУспехи французской и немецкой сурдопедагогических школ привели к распространению специальных учреждений (школ для глухих) в других странах, при этом как правило заимствовались либо только сурдопедагогические идеи (например, в Англии), либо методика целиком, включая и сам жестовый язык. Первая такая школа в США открылась в 1817 г. в Хартфорде (штат Коннектикут); работала по французской методике. В результате самостоятельный американский язык жестов слабослышащих — амслен () имеет больше сходства с французским (LSF) и практически не имеет ничего общего с британским жестовым языком (BSL). Амслен является самым распространённым в Северной Америке (США и англоязычной Канаде) и некоторых других странах языком глухих (при том, что он радикально отличается от соответствующего британского языка жестов). Каждый жест состоит из жестовых единиц — хирем, которых в языке 55. Амслен, развивающийся с первой четверти XIX века, постоянно пополняется новыми жестами и считается самостоятельным живым языком с чрезвычайно широким спектром применения. Методики пионера американской сурдопедагогики (теории и практики обучения глухих) Томаса Галлодета () продолжают успешно применяться и далее — в 1973 году в Вашингтоне организован первый университет для глухих, названный в честь учёного (Галлаудетский университет), в котором обучаются глухие студенты из различных стран.\n\nРу́сский же́стовый язы́к — язык жестов, используемый русскоязычным сообществом глухих и слабослышащих в России, а также сообществами глухих и слабослышащих на территории СНГ (Украина, Белоруссия, Казахстан). При этом его грамматика сильно отличается от грамматики русского языка: поскольку слова сложнее преобразовывать морфологически, то грамматика (например, порядок и образование слов) более строгая, чем в русском языке. Русский жестовый язык относится к семье французской жестовой речи, близок к амслену, а также немало лексики заимствовано из австрийского жестового языка. Тем не менее, разговорный жестовый язык имеет свою собственную грамматику и используется в повседневном общении глухих, тогда как созданный специально для удобства общения между слабослышащими и слышащими людьми нечто среднее между русским жестовым языком и русским звуковым языком — сурдоперевод (иногда называемый «калькированный жестовый язык», «калькированная речь», «калькирующая жестовая речь» или «К��Я») используется, в основном, в официальном общении, например при сурдопереводе лекций в институте, докладов на конференциях. Одно время сурдоперевод применялся на телевидении, позволяя лицам с нарушением слуха воспринимать программы новостей. Калькирующая жестовая речь использует как знаки разговорного жестового языка, так и специально разработанные знаки для понятий, не имеющих своих представлений в словаре разговорного жестового языка. В ней применяются элементы дактильной речи для обозначения окончаний, суффиксов и прочего. Кроме того, для обозначения имён собственных, а также специфических терминов существует русская дактильная азбука.\n\nСоциальные особенности\n\nДискриминация \nВ настоящее время дискриминации как таковой нет, однако во многом нужды людей со снижением или отсутствием слуха не учитываются. Так, в России на сегодняшний день многие звуковые сигналы (например, объявление остановок при поездках в общественном транспорте, сигналы домофона) в большинстве случаев не дублируются графическими и световыми устройствами вывода информации. Зачастую переоснащение и адаптирование оборудования лицам с данной патологией приходится выполнять за свой счет.\n\nНарушения до и после развития речи\n\nГосударственный статус\n\nКультура глухих\n\nСм. также \n Аудизм\n Всероссийское общество глухих\n Глухонемота\n Институт уха в Лос-Анджелесе\n Кондуктивная тугоухость\n Кохлеарный имплантат\n Нейросенсорная тугоухость\n Слепоглухота\n Слуховой аппарат\n Телекоммуникационное устройство для глухих\n Стволомозговой имплантат\n Украинское общество глухих\n Защитные наушники\n\nПримечания\n\nЛитература \n Александр Мещеряков Познание мира без слуха и зрения\n\nСсылки \n «Глухих.нет» — Информационно-развлекательный портал для людей с проблемами слуха.\n http://www.deafworld.ru/\n Сайт межрегиональной молодёжной общественной организации «Мир слабослышащих»\n «Наша жизнь» — еженедельник для ��еслышащих людей\n \n Нарушения слуха у детей и взрослых\n\nКатегория:Заболевания уха\nКатегория:Глухота\nКатегория:Слух\nКатегория:Сурдология", "question": {"question": "\nWhat are some factors that can cause hearing loss?", "questionCategory": "causal reasoning", "comprehension": "superficial"}, "answer": "\n\nBased on the text, some factors that can cause hearing loss include:\n\n* Genetic disorders of hearing: There are both non-syndromic (isolated) and syndromic disorders of hearing.
